It was about five in the morning when [lb]	
I entered my fathers house. I told the servant[add]	s
 
         [lb]	
not to disturb the family[add]	,
 and went into [lb]	
the library to attend their usual time of [lb]	
rising. Five years had elapsed–passed as [lb]	
a dream but for one indelible trace, and [lb]	
I stood in the same place where I had last [lb]	
embraced my father before my departure [lb]	
for Ingolstadt. Beloved and respectable [lb]	
parent! [delSpan]	
His chair was before the
      reading [lb]	
desk and a book open[anchor]	
 He still remained [lb]	
to me. I gazed on a picture of my mother [lb]	
which stood over the mantlepiece. It was [lb]	
an historical piece painted to please my [lb]	
father and represented Caroline Beaumont [lb]	
in an agony of despair kneeling by the coffin [lb]	
of her dead father. Her garb was rustic[add]	,
 &
      her [lb]

flowed when I look[add]	ed
 upon it—While I was [lb]

He expressed the greatest delight on seeing [lb]
