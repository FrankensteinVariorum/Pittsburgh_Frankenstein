I was according <br/>ly conducted by the Magistrate &amp; several <br/>other persons to the Inn. I could not <br/>help being struck by the strange coin <br/>cidences that had taken place during <br/>this eventful night but knowing that <br/>I had been  conversing with several <br/>persons in the island I had inhabited <br/>about the time that the body had been found</p></div></body></html>
