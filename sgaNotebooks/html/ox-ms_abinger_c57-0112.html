The sky had become clouded but the <br/>air was pure although  chilled by the <br/>North-East breeze that was rising. But <br/>it refreshed &amp; filled me with such agreable <br/>sensations that I resolved to prolong <br/>my stay on the water &amp; fixing the rudder <br/> <br/>in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. <br/>Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure <br/>&amp; I heard only the sound of the boat as it <br/>keel cut through the waves–The sound <br/>lulled me–&amp; in a short time I slept  <br/>soundly</p><p> <br/>I do not know how long I remained in <br/>this situation but when I awoke I found <br/>that the sun had already mounted considerably– <br/>The wind was high and the waves 
      continually <br/>threatened the safety of my little 
      skiff— <br/>I  found that the wind was
      north- <br/>east and must have driven me far <br/>from the coast from which I had embarked. <br/>I endeavoured to change my course but <br/>quickly found that if I again made the attempt <br/>the boat would be instantly filled with <br/>water. Thus situated my only resource was <br/>to drive before the wind –  I
      confess <br/>that I felt a few sensations of terror –I had <br/>no compass with me and was so little <br/>acquainted with the geography of this part <br/>of the world that the sun was of little be <br/>nefit to me –I might be  driven
      into <br/>the wide Atlantic &amp; feel all the tortures <br/>of starvation or be swallowed up in <br/>immeasurable waters that roared &amp;</p></div></body></html>
