At that moment I peceiv <br/>ing a woman passing near me,– she <br/>was young; not indeed so beautiful as <br/>her who portrait I held but of an <br/>agreable  aspect &amp; blooming in the <br/>loveliness of health &amp; youth. And here <br/>I thought is one  of those whose <br/>smiles are bestowed on all but me <br/> She shall not escape my vengeance <br/>thanks to the lessons of Felix &amp; the <br/>sanguinary laws of man, I have learned how <br/>to work mischief. I approached her <br/>unpeceived, and placed the portrait <br/>securely in one of the folds of her <br/>dress.</p><p> <br/>For some day I haunted the spot <br/>where these scenes had taken place <br/>sometimes wishing to see you some <br/>times resolved to quit the world &amp; it <br/>miseries for ever. At length I wandered <br/> <br/>towards  these mountains and have ranged <br/> <br/>through  their immense recesses consumed <br/>by a burning passion which you <br/>alone can gratify—And we may not <br/>part untill you have promised <br/>to comply with my requisitions. I am <br/>alone &amp; miserable. Man will not <br/>associate with but one as deformed <br/>and horrible as my self would not <br/>deny herself to me. This being you <br/>must create.</p></div></body></html>
