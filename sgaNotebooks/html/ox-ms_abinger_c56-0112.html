      My <br/>abhorrence of this fiend cannot be <br/>conceived â€“ When I thought of him I <br/>gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflam <br/>ed and I ardently wished to extinguish <br/>that life which I had so thoughtlessly <br/>bestowed. When I  reflected on his <br/>crimes and malice, my hatred and <br/>revenge burst all bounds of moderation <br/> <br/> I would have made a pilgrimage <br/>to the highestpeak of the Andes could I when
      there <br/>have precipitated him to their base; I <br/>wished but to see him again that <br/>I might wreak the utmost extent of <br/>anger on his head and avenge the <br/>deaths of William and Justine.</p><p> <br/>Our house was  the
      house <br/>of mourning, my father's health was deeply <br/>shaken by the horror of the recent <br/>events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding <br/>she no longer took delight in her <br/>ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed <br/>to her sacriledge towards the dead; eter <br/>nal <br/>woe and tears she then thought was the <br/>just tribute she should pay to innocence <br/>so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer <br/>that happy creature </p></div></body></html>
