I collected bones from <br/>Charnel houses and with profane fingers <br/>meddled with the secrets of the human <br/>frame. In a solitary chamber–or rather <br/>cell at the top of the house and seperated <br/>from all other appartments by a gallery <br/>and staircase I  kept my workshop <br/>of filthy creation; my eyeballs were <br/>starting from their sockets in at- <br/>tending to the minutiæ of  my <br/>employment. The dissecting room and <br/>the slaughter house furnished many <br/>of my materials, and often did my <br/>human nature turn from my <br/>occupation whilst still urged <br/>on by an eagerness which perpetually encreased, <br/> <br/>I brought my work  near to a conclusion.</p><p> <br/>The  Summer
