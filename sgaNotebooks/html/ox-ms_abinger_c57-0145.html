      you; <br/>and be assured that if a lively joy is not <br/>painted in my face my heart is content. <br/>Something whispers to me not to depend too <br/>much on the prospect which is opened <br/>before us but I will not listen to such <br/>a sinister voice – Observe how fast we <br/>move along &amp; how the clouds which some <br/>times obscure &amp; sometimes rise above <br/>the  dome of Mont Blanc render this <br/>scene of beauty still more interresting. <br/>Look also at the innumerable fish that <br/>are swimming in these clear waters where <br/>we can distinguish every pebble that lies <br/>at the bottom. What a divine day; how <br/>happy &amp; serene all nature appears!</p><p> <br/>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert <br/>her thoughts &amp; mine from all reflection on melancholy <br/>subjects but her temper was fluctuating. <br/>joy for a few instants shone in her eyes <br/>but it continually gave place to distrac <br/>tion &amp; reverie.</p><p> <br/>The sun sunk lower in the heavens</p></div></body></html>
