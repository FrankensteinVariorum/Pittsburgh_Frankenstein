You are no longer at a formidable <br/>distance and I may hope to see you in <br/>less than a fortnight. My poor Cousin! <br/>How much must you have suffered! <br/>I expect to see you looking even more <br/>ill than when you quitted Geneva. This <br/>winter has been passed most miserably <br/>but although happiness will not shine <br/>in our eyes for many months yet I <br/>hope to see peace in your countenance &amp; to <br/>find that your heart is not totally <br/>devoid of comfort &amp; tranquility.</p><p> <br/>Yet I fear that the same
      feelings <br/>now exist that made you so miserable <br/>a year ago even perhaps augmented by time. <br/>I would not at this period disturb you <br/>when so many misfortunes weigh upon <br/>you but a conversation that I had <br/>with my uncle previous to his departure <br/>renders some explanation necessary <br/>before we meet.</p><p> <br/>Explanation, you may possibly say, <br/>what can Elizabeth have to explain? <br/>If you really say this my questions are <br/>answered and I have no more to do than <br/>to sign myself your affectionate cousin. <br/>But you are distant from me &amp;  <br/> it is possible that you may dread &amp; <br/>yet be pleased with this explanation <br/> <br/> and inthe probability of <br/>this being the case I dare not postpone <br/>any longer to write what during your <br/>absence I have often wished to express to</p></div></body></html>
