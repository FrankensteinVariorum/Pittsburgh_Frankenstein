I <br/>preferred this  plan principally because <br/>I dreaded to see again those places in which <br/>I had enjoyed a few moments of tranquilli <br/>ty with my beloved Clerval – And I thought <br/>with horror of seeing those men whom <br/>we had been accustomed to visit together <br/>and who, doubtless, would make enquiries <br/>concerning an event the very remembrance <br/>of which made me again feel what I <br/>endured when I gazed on his lifeless form.</p><p> <br/>As for my father; his desires &amp; exer <br/>tions were bounded to the again seeing <br/>me  restored to health and peace of <br/>mind. His tenderness &amp; attentions were <br/>unremitting, my grief and gloom was obsti- <br/>nate but he would not despair. Some <br/>times he thought that I felt deeply <br/>the degradation of being obliged to answer <br/>a charge of murder and he endeavoured <br/>to prove to me the futility of pride. <br/>Alas! my father, said I, how little do you <br/>know me: human beings, their feelings <br/>and passions would indeed be degraded <br/>if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine <br/>poor unhappy Justine was as innocent <br/>as I and she suffered the same charge, <br/>she died for it – And I am the cause <br/>of this – I murdered her. William</p></div></body></html>
