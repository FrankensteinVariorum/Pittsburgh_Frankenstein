Oh how I hate all its shews <br/>and mockeries.– When one creature is <br/>murderedanother is immediately  <br/>deprive of life in a slow torturing <br/>manner &amp; then the executioners their hands yet reeking
          with the blood of innocence believe that they have done <br/>a great deed. They call this retribution; hate <br/>ful name! When that word is pronounced <br/>I know that greater and more horrid <br/>punishments are going to be inflicted <br/>than the gloomiest tyrant has ever in <br/>ventented to satiatehis utmost revenge. Yet this <br/>is not consolation for you, my Justine, <br/>unless indeed that you may glory <br/>in escaping so miserable a den. Alas! <br/>I would I were in peace with my aunt &amp; my <br/>sweet William –  escaped <br/>from light which is hateful to me and the <br/>visages of men which  <br/>" I abhor.</p><p> <br/>Justine smiled languidly. "This, dear Lady <br/>said she is despair and not resignation. <br/>I must not learn the lesson that you <br/>would teach me – talk of somthing else <br/> of something that will  <br/>bring joy and not encrease of misery."</p></div></body></html>
