I feared the <br/>vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet <br/>I I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task.  <br/>My health  which had hitherto declined <br/>was now much restored, &amp; my spirits when <br/>unchecked by the memory of my unhappy <br/>promise, rose proportionably. My father <br/>saw this with pleasure and he turned his <br/>thoughts towards the best method of <br/>eradicating the remains of my melancholyâ€“ <br/>which every now and then would return <br/>by fits &amp; with a devouring blackness over <br/>cast the approaching sunshine. At these <br/>moments I took refuge in the most <br/>perfect solitude: Alone <br/>in a little boatI passed whole days
      on <br/>the lake watching the clouds &amp; listening to the rippling <br/>of the waves, silent &amp; listless. But the fresh <br/>air and bright sun seldom failed to <br/>restore me to some degree of compo- <br/>sure &amp;  on my return I met the <br/> salutations of my friends with a <br/>readier smile, &amp; a more cheerful heart</p><p> <br/>It was after my return from one <br/>of these rambles that my father calling <br/>me aside thus addressed me.</p><p> <br/>I am happy to remark, my dear <br/>son, that  you have  <br/>resumed your former pleasures &amp; seem <br/>to be returning to yourself. And yet <br/> you are still
      unhappy &amp; still avoid <br/>our society.  For some time</p></div></body></html>
