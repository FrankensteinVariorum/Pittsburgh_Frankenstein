The wind fanned the fire <br/>and the cottage was quickly enveloped <br/>by the flames which clung to it <br/>and  licked it with  <br/>their forked &amp; destroying tongues,  <br/>. As soon as I was convinced that <br/>no  assistance could save any <br/>part of the habitation I quitted <br/>the scene and sought for refuge <br/>in the wood.</p><p> <br/>And now  with the
      world before <br/>me whither should I bend my steps? <br/>I resolved to fly far from the scene <br/>of my misfortunes – But to me, hated <br/>and despised, every country  <br/>must be equally horrible.– At length <br/>the thought of you crossed my <br/>mind — I learned from your papers <br/>that you were my creator &amp; to whom <br/> could I apply with more fitness <br/>than to him who had given me life. <br/>Among the lessons that Felix had <br/>bestowed on Safie geography <br/>had not been ommitted. From <br/>these I had learned the relative <br/>situations of the different countries <br/> <br/>of the earth; You had mentioned Geneva as <br/>the name of your native town <br/>&amp; to this
      place I resolved to <br/>proceed.</p></div></body></html>
