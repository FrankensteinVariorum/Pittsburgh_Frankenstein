"I know that while <br/>"you are pleased with yourself you <br/>"will  think of us with affection <br/>"and we shall hear regularly from <br/>"you. And you must pardon me <br/>"if I regard  any interruption <br/>"in your corespondence, as a proof <br/>"that your other duties are equal- <br/>"ly neglected" I  knew well <br/>therefore what his  would <br/>be his feelings but I could not tear my
      thoughts <br/>from my occupation loathsome in <br/>itself but which had taken an <br/> <br/>irresistible hold of my  imagination. <br/>I wished as it were to  procras <br/>tinate all that related to my feelings of affection, untill <br/>the great object which swallowed up every habit <br/> of my nature should be <br/>compleated.</p><p> <br/>I then thought that my father <br/>would be  unjust if he ascribed my <br/>neglect to vice or faultiness on my <br/>part; but I am now convinced <br/>that he was <br/> he was in the <br/>right in conceiv <br/>ing that I <br/>should not be <br/>altogether free <br/>from blame.. A human <br/>being in perfection ought always to <br/>preserve a  calm and peaceful <br/>mind and never to allow passion</p></div></body></html>
