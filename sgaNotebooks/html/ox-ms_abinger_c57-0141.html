      is <br/>no peace:  the agonies of <br/>remorse poison the luxury there other <br/>wise is sometimes found in indulging  the excess of grief.</p><p> <br/>Soon after my arrival my father <br/>spoke of my immediate marriage with <br/>my cousin.

Heavy misfortunes <br/>have befallen us but let  us only <br/>cling closer to what remains  and <br/>transfer our love for those whom <br/>we have lost to those who yet live. <br/>Our circle will be small but bound <br/>close by the ties of affection &amp; mutual <br/>misfortune— And when time will have <br/> <br/>softened your despair  new &amp; dear <br/>cares will be born to replace those <br/> <br/>of whom we have been so cruelly deprived .</p><p> <br/>Such were the lessons of my <br/>father but to me the remembrance of the threat returned</p></div></body></html>
