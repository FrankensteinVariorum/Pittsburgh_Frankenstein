This day was passed in <br/>the same routine as the preceeding one. <br/>The  young man was constantly <br/>employed out of doors and the girl in <br/>various laborious occupations within..— The old <br/>man whom I soon perceived to be blind <br/>employed his leisure hours in playing <br/>on his instrument or in  <br/>contemplation – Nothing could exceed <br/>the love &amp; respect that the younger <br/>cottagers shewed towards this venerable <br/>old man – They performed towards him every <br/>little office of affection &amp; duty with gentleness; <br/>and he rewarded them by his benevo <br/>lent smiles. </p><p> <br/>They were not however entirely <br/>happy–The  young man &amp; his <br/>companion, often retired into a corner <br/>of their common room and wept. I saw <br/>no cause for this unhappiness but <br/>I was deeply affected by it – If such <br/>lovely creatures were miserable it was <br/>less strange that 
      I, an imperfect <br/>and solitary being should be wretched—</p></div></body></html>
