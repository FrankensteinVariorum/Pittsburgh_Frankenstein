      bitterness &amp; <br/>horror of my feelings.</p><p> <br/>I generally rested during the <br/>day, and travelled only when I was se <br/>cured by night from the view of man. <br/> one morning however
      finding <br/>that my path lay through a deep <br/>wood I ventured to continue my  <br/> <br/>journey  after the sun had risen
         <br/>. The day which was one <br/>of the first of spring  cheered <br/> <br/>even me by the loveliness of its sunshine &amp; <br/>the gentleness of the breeze. – I felt  <br/> <br/>emotions of softness and pleasure that
      had <br/>long appeared dead, revive within me; <br/>half surprized with these new sensa <br/>tions I allowed myself to be borne <br/>away by them &amp;  forgetting
      my <br/>solitude &amp; deformity dared to be happy <br/>tears of gentleness again bedewed my <br/>cheeks and I even raised my humid eyes <br/>with thankfullness towards the blessed <br/>sun which bestowed  such joy upon me</p></div></body></html>
