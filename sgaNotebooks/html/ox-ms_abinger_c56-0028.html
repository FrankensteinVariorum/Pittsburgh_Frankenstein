For <br/>there was a certain dignity in his <br/>manner during his lectures which <br/>was replaced by the greatest  <br/>affability and kindness in his own <br/>house. He heard my little narration <br/>concerning my studies with attention <br/>smiled at the names of Cornelius <br/>Agrippa and Paracelsus but
      without <br/>the contempt that Mr Krempe had <br/>expressed to them.  <br/> <br/>He said that <br/>these were <br/>men to whose <br/>indefatigable zeal <br/>modernnatural <br/>philosophers were <br/>indebted for most <br/>of the foundations <br/>of their knowledge <br/> <br/>Theyhadleft to <br/>us, as an easier <br/>task to give new <br/>names, &amp; arrange <br/>in conected classi <br/>fications the <br/>facts which they <br/>to a great degree <br/>had been the <br/>instruments of <br/>bringing to light. <br/>The labours of <br/>men of genius <br/>however erroneously <br/>directed scarce <br/>ly ever failed. that <br/>his lecture had removed my prejudice <br/>against modern chemists and I request- <br/>ed at the same time his advice <br/>concerning the books I ought to procure</p></div></body></html>
