      Lausanne for <br/>two days not daring to proceed. I contem <br/>plated the lake – the waters were <br/>placid – all around was calm and the <br/>Snowy mountains the "Palaces of Nature" <br/>were not changed. By degrees, this calm <br/>and heavenly scene restored me, and I <br/> <br/>continued my journey towards Geneva. The road <br/>ran by the side of the lake which <br/>became narrower as I approached <br/>my native town – I discovered more <br/>distinctly the black sides of Jura; <br/>and the brightsummit of Mount Blanc– <br/>I wept like a child– Dear mountains <br/>my own beautiful lake how do you <br/>welcome your wanderer Your sum <br/>mits are clear the sky and lake <br/>are blue is this toprognosticate peace <br/>or to mockat my unhappiness?</p><p> <br/>I fear, my friend that I shall render myself <br/>tedious by dwelling on these preliminary <br/>circumstances but they were days of <br/>comparative happiness and I think <br/>of them with pleasure – My Country <br/>my beloved country Who but a nativecan tell the <br/>delight I took in again beholding thy <br/>streams thy mountains and more than <br/>all thy lovely lake </p></div></body></html>
