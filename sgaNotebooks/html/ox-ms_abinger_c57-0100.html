With this resolution I traversed <br/>the northern highlands and fixed on one of the <br/>Orkney Islands for the scene of my labours. <br/> It was a place fitted for such a work; <br/>being hardly more than a rock whose high <br/>sides were continually beaten upon by the <br/>waves– The soil was barren hardly affording <br/>pasture for a few miserable cows &amp; oat <br/>meal for its  inhabitants which consis <br/>ted of five persons, Whose gaunt &amp;
      scraggy <br/>limbs gave tokens of their sorry fare.  <br/> Vegetables &amp; bread, when they indulged <br/>in such luxuries, &amp; even fresh water was <br/>to be procured from the main land which <br/>was about five miles distant. On the <br/>whole island there were but three mise <br/>rable huts &amp; one of these was vacant <br/>when I arrived. This I hired– It contained <br/>but two rooms &amp;  these exhibited all <br/>the squalidness of the most miserable <br/>penury— The thatch had fallen in – the <br/>walls were unplastered &amp; the door was off
      its <br/>hinges. I ordered it to be repaired,  bought <br/>some furniture &amp; took possession – an <br/>incident which would have doubtless occasioned <br/>some surprise had not all the  senses <br/>of the cottagers been benumbed by want</p></div></body></html>
