      are <br/>preserved by that bloody hallo with glory and victory always decora <br/>its worshippers; but the effects of their conquest were but mome <br/>tary and gave way before the rapid advances of Cyrus whose <br/>warfare conducted on principles of utility and benevolence <br/>red through the lapse of many ages</p><p> <br/>The memory of Cyrus is contemplated with peculiar <br/>complacency by  most historians. His
      humanity and love <br/>of justice distinguishes him those other conquerors to whom <br/>ambition is the ruling motive. Cyrus was educated in the <br/>strictest simplicity,
