        fortunate chance <br/>had intervened to prevent the execution
        of his menace, – When suddenly <br/>I heard a shrill &amp; dreadful scream.– <br/>It came from the room into which <br/>Elizabeth had retired. <br/>As I heard it the whole truth rushed <br/>to my mind my arms dropped – the <br/>motion of every muscle &amp; fibre was <br/>suspended I could feel the blood trick <br/>ling  in my veins – &amp; tingling in my feet <br/>This state lasted but an instant <br/>the scream was repeated &amp; I rushed <br/>into the room. Great God why did I <br/>not then expire – Why I am I here to <br/>relate the destruction of the best hope <br/>&amp; the purest creature of earth – She was <br/>there – lifeless &amp; inanimate – thrown <br/>across the bed her head hanging <br/>down her pale &amp; distorted features half <br/>covered by her hair – Every where I turn <br/>I see the same figure —Her bloodless</p></div></body></html>
