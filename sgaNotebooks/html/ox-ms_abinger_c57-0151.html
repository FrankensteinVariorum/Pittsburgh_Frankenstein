      I <br/>started up &amp; resolved to return to Geneva <br/>with all possible speed. There were no horses <br/>to be procured and I must return by the <br/>lake but the wind was unfavourable <br/>and the rain fell in torrents. It was however <br/>hardly yet morning and I might reasonably hope to arrive <br/> by night –I hired a number
      of <br/>men to row and took an oar myself for <br/>I had always experienced relief from mental  torment in bodily exercise. <br/>But the overflowing misery I now felt <br/>&amp; the excess of agitation that I endured <br/>rendered me incapable of any exertion–I <br/>threw down the oar &amp; leaning my head <br/>upon my hands gave way to every <br/>gloomy idea that arose—If I looked up <br/>I saw the scenes which were familiar <br/>to me in my happier time and which I had <br/>contemplated but the day before in the compa <br/>ny of her who was now but a shadow &amp; a <br/>recollection – tears streamed from my <br/>eyes – I looked on the lake the <br/>rain had ceased for a moment &amp; I  <br/>saw the fish play in the waters as I <br/>had done  but  a few <br/>hours before – they had then been observed by <br/>Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human <br/>mind as great &amp; sudden change – The sun</p></div></body></html>
