She <br/>followed , and they <br/>diasppeared – Presently I saw the young man <br/>again with some tools in his hand cross the <br/>field opposite the cottage and the girl was <br/>also busied sometimes in  the cottage <br/>and sometimes in the yard where she fed <br/>some  chickens. While <br/>I examined my dwelling I discovered that part <br/>of the cottage window had formerly occupied <br/>a corner of it  but the panes had  been <br/>filled up with wood. In one of these was <br/>a small &amp; allmost imperceptible  chink, <br/>through which  the eye could just <br/>penetrate; thro this chink a <br/>small room was visible, whitewashed &amp; clean but very <br/>bare of furniture  in  one corner near <br/>a small fire sate an old man  leaning <br/>his head on his hand  in a disconslate atti <br/>tude —  The young girl was  occupied in <br/>arranging the cottage but presently <br/> she took somthing out of
         a drawer <br/>which employed her hands &amp; sat down beside  the old <br/>man who taking up an 
      instrument began <br/>to play and to produce sounds sweeter than <br/>the voice of the thrush or nightingale.</p></div></body></html>
