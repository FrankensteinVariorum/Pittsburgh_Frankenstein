      father,– heard the silver tones of <br/>my Elizabeths voice and beheld Clerval <br/>enjoying health &amp; youth – Often when <br/>wearied by a toilsome march I persua <br/>ded myself that I was  dreaming until night should come &amp; <br/>that  I should then enjoy reality  <br/>in the arms of my dearest friends–What <br/>agonizing fondness did I feel for them–how <br/>did I cling to their dear forms as sometimes
      they hauntedeven <br/> <br/>the visions of <br/>my waking <br/>hours and
      per <br/>suade myself that they still lived. At such <br/>moments the vengeance that burned <br/>within me died in my heart and I pursued <br/>my path towards the destruction of the dæ <br/>mon more as a task enjoined by heaven,  <br/>than the ardent desire of my soul.</p><p> <br/>What his feelings were whom I pur <br/>sued I cannot know – Sometimes indeed he <br/>left marks in writing on the barks of <br/>trees or cut on stone that guided me, <br/>&amp; instigated my fury — My reign is not yet <br/>over, was legiblein one of these inscriptions–– You live &amp; <br/>my power is complete. Follow me –I seek <br/>the everlasting ices of the north where you <br/>will feel the misery of  cold &amp; frost
         <br/> <br/> <br/> to which I am <br/>impassive You will find near this place <br/>if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare <br/>eat &amp; be revived.  Come on my
      enemy</p></div></body></html>
