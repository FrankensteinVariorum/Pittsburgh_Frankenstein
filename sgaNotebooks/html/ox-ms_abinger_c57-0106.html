I have en <br/>dured incalculable fatigue &amp; cold &amp; hunger  <br/>do you dare destroy my hopes?</p><p> <br/>Begone, I replied; I do break my  <br/>promise; never will create another like <br/>yourself, equal in deformity &amp; wickedness.</p><p> <br/>Slave, said the wretch, I before <br/>reasoned with you – but you have proved <br/>yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remem <br/>ber that I have power; you believe your <br/>self miserable but I can make you so <br/>wretched that the light of day  will <br/>be hateful to you. You are my creator <br/>but I am your master; obey!</p><p> <br/>Wretch, said I, the hour of my weak- <br/>ness is past &amp; the period of your power is <br/>arrived. Your threats cannot move me <br/>to do an act of wickedness but they confirm <br/>me in a resolution of not creating you <br/>companion in vice. Shall I in cold blood <br/>set loose upon the earth a dæmon <br/>whose delight is in death &amp; wretchedness. <br/>Begone, I am firm and your words will <br/>only exasperate my rage.</p><p> <br/>The Monster saw my determination <br/>in my face and gnashed his teeth in the <br/>impotence of anger. Shall each man, cried <br/>he, find his equal, &amp; each beast have <br/>his mate  and I be alone. I had feelings <br/>of affection &amp; they were returned by detes <br/>tation. Man you may hate, but beware!</p></div></body></html>
