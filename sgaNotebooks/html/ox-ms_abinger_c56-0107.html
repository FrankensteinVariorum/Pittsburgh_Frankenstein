I never could again have <br/>known peace if I had been deceived <br/>in my reliance on her. For the mo <br/>ment that I did believe it I felt <br/> anguish that I could not have <br/>long sustained. Now my heart is light <br/>ened. The innocent suffers – but she <br/>whom I thought amiable and good <br/>is not wicked and I am consoled."</p><p> <br/>Amiable Cousin! Such were your <br/>thoughts mild and gentle as your <br/>dear eyes  and voice. <br/>but I.—— I was a wretch  &amp; <br/>none ever conceived  the misery <br/>that I then suffered.</p></div></body></html>
