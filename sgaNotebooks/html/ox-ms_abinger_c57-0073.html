But the medecine <br/>had been fatal &amp; unable to account <br/>for the excess of misery I appeared to <br/>suffer he hastened to return home <br/>hoping that the quiet &amp; calm of a domestic <br/>life would by degrees alleviate my suf- <br/>ferings from whatsoever cause they <br/>might spring.</p><p> <br/>For myself I was passive in all <br/>their arrangements, and the gentle <br/>affection of my beloved Elizabeth was <br/>inadequate to draw me from the <br/>depth of my despair. The promise I <br/>had made to the d√¶mon weighed <br/>upon my mind like Dante's iron <br/>cowl on the head of the hellish hypo <br/>crites. all pleasures of earth or sky <br/>passed before me as a dream &amp; that <br/>one thought only had to me the <br/>reality of life. Can you wonder that <br/>sometimes a kind of insanity possessed <br/>me or that I saw about me a <br/>multitude of filthy animals inflic <br/>ting on me incessant torture that <br/>often extorted  screams &amp; <br/>bitter groans.</p><p> <br/>By degrees however these <br/>feelings became calmed. I entered <br/>again into the every day of life if <br/>not with interrest at least with <br/>some degree of tranquillity.</p></div></body></html>
