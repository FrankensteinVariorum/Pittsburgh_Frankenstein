In this expedition we did <br/>not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh <br/>But to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock &amp; the <br/>Cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the <br/>completion of this tour about the end of <br/>July. I packed my chemical instruments <br/>&amp; the materials which I had collected resolv- <br/>ing to finish my labours in some obscure <br/>nook in the country.</p><p> <br/>We quitted London on the 27 of <br/>March and remained a few days at Windsor <br/>rambling in its beautiful forest. This was <br/>a new scene to us mountaineers; The majectic <br/> oaks the quantity of
      game &amp; the  <br/> flocks of lovely deer were all novelties <br/>to us. From thence we proceeded to Oxford. <br/>We were charmed with the appearance <br/>of the town. The colledges are antient and <br/>picturesque, the streets broard &amp; the lands <br/>cape rendered perfect by the lovely Isis. <br/>which  spreads into broard &amp; <br/>placid expance of water &amp; runs south <br/>of the town. We had  letters to several <br/>of the professors who received us with great <br/>politeness &amp;  cordiality. We found that the <br/>regulations of this university were much <br/>improved since the days of Gibbon; But <br/>there is still  in fashion a great
      deal <br/>of bigotry &amp; devotion to established rules that <br/>constrains the mind of the students &amp; leads <br/>to slavish &amp; narrow principles of action.</p></div></body></html>
