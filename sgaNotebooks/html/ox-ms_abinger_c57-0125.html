      strange <br/>chances that have lately  occurred. <br/>You were thrown, by some surprising <br/>accident, on this shore, renowned for its <br/>hospitality  <br/>Siezed immediately &amp; charged with murder <br/>the first sight that was presented to your <br/>eyes was the body of your friend mur <br/>dered in so unaccountable a manner <br/>and placed by some fiend as it were across <br/>your path— </p><p> <br/>As M<span class="sup hi">r</span>. Kirwin said this,
      notwithstanding <br/>the agitation that I  endured on this <br/>retrospect of my sufferings–I also felt <br/>considerable surprise at the knowledge <br/>he seemed to possess concerning me. <br/>I suppose some astonishment was expressed <br/>in my countenance – for M<span class="sup hi">r</span>. Kirwin <br/>hastened to say – It was not untill a day <br/>or two after your illness that I thought <br/>of examining your dress that I might <br/>discover some trace by which I could <br/>send to your relations an account of your <br/>misfortune and illness. I found several letters <br/>among others one which I discovered by its commence <br/>ment to be from your father – I instant <br/>ly wrote to Geneva – nearly two months has <br/>passed since the departure of my letter — <br/>But you are ill – even now you tremble <br/> <br/>You appear unfit for agitation of any kind.</p><p> <br/>This suspence,  is
      a thousand <br/>times worse than the most horrible <br/>event –Tell me what new scene of death <br/>has been acted &amp; whose murder I am <br/>now to lament.</p></div></body></html>
