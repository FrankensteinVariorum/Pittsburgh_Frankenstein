The child still struggled <br/>&amp; loaded me with epithets which carried <br/>despair to my heart – I grasped his throat <br/>to silence him &amp; in a moment he lay <br/>dead at my feet.</p><p> <br/>I gazed on my victim and my heart <br/>swelled with exultation and hellish <br/>triumph —  clapping my hands  I exclaimed <br/>I too can make desolate. – My enemy is not impreg <br/>nable; this death will carry despair to <br/>him &amp; a thousand thousand others miseries <br/> shall torment &amp; destroy him. <br/>As I fixed my eyes on the child I saw <br/> <br/>something glittering on his breast – I took
      it <br/>I was the portrait of a most lovely woman. <br/>In spite of my malignity  it <br/>softened and attracted me. for a few <br/>moments I gazed with delight on her <br/>dark deep eyes &amp; lovely lips but <br/>presently my rage returned: I remembered <br/>that I was for ever deprived of the <br/>delights such  beautiful
      creatures <br/>could bestow – and that  she whose <br/>resemblance I contemplated  would, <br/> in regarding me have, changed <br/>that air of divine benignity to one of <br/>horror &amp; detestation.</p><p> <br/>Can you wonder that such <br/>thoughts transported me with rage? <br/>I only wonder that at that moment <br/>instead of venting my sensations in <br/>useless exclamations &amp; agony I did not <br/>rush among mankind and perish <br/>in the attempt to destroy them.</p></div></body></html>
