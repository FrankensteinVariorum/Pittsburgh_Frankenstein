      pursued <br/>him even to that irremediable ruin. There he <br/>lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but <br/>your abhorrence cannot equal that with <br/>which I regard myself. I look on the hands which <br/>executed the deed, I think on the heart in which the <br/>imagination of it was conceived, and long for the <br/>moment when they will meet my eyes, when it <br/>will haunt my thoughts no 
      more.</p><p> <br/>Fear not that I shall be the instrument <br/>of future mischief. My work is nearly  com- <br/>plete. Neither yours nor any mans death is needed to <br/>consummate the series of my being, and accomplish <br/>that which must be done; but it requires my own. <br/>Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this</p></div></body></html>
