There is somthing terribly appall <br/>ing in our situation Yet my courage &amp; hopes do <br/>not desert me — We may survive &amp; if we do not – <br/>I will repeat the lessons of my Seneca &amp; die with a <br/>good heart.</p><p> <br/>Yet what, Margaret, will
      be your state – You <br/>will not hear of my destruction and you will <br/>anxiously await my return – Years will pass <br/>and you will have visitings of despair &amp; <br/>yet be cheered by hope. Oh my beloved sister <br/>the  sicknening failings of your heart <br/>felt expectations  are in prospect <br/>more terrible to me than my own death –But <br/>you have a husband and lovely children— <br/>you may be happy — Heaven bless you &amp; <br/>make you so.</p><p> <br/>My  unfortunate guest regards <br/>me with the tenderest compassion – He <br/> endeavours to fill me with hope – And <br/>talks as if life were a thing which he loved <br/>He reminds me how often the same acci <br/>dents have happened to other navigators, <br/>who have attempted the same sea. In <br/>spite of myself he fills me with cheerful <br/>auguries. Even the sailors feel the benefit <br/>of his eloquence – when he speaks they <br/>no longer despair – he rouzes their ener <br/>gies &amp; they believe  these vast mountains <br/>of ice are mole hills which will va <br/>nish before the resolutions of man. <br/> this is but transitory and each <br/>days expectation delayed, fills them fear &amp; <br/>I almost dread the mutiny of despair</p></div></body></html>
