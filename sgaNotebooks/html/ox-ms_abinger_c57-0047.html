"Are these Germans"–  Asked <br/>De Lacey – "No –They are
      french –But let <br/>us change the subject –I am an unfortu <br/>nate &amp; deserted creature. I look around and <br/>I have no relation or friend on earth – Theseamiable <br/>people to whom I go, have never seem <br/>me and know little of me. I am full <br/>of fears, for if I fail there, I am an <br/>outcast in the world for ever."</p><p> <br/>Do not despair, said the old man. <br/>To be friendless is indeed to be unfortu <br/>nate: but the hearts of men  when unpre <br/>judiced by obvious self interrest, are full <br/>of brotherly love and charity. Rely therefore <br/>on your hopes and if  <br/> these friends <br/>are good and amiable – do not despair</p></div></body></html>
