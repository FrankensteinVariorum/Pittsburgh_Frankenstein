I trembled, and my heart failed  <br/>within me, when on looking up I saw <br/>by the light of the moon, the dæmon at the  <br/>casement. <br/>A ghastly grin 
      wrinkled <br/>lips, as he gazed on me where I sat. Yes, he had <br/>followed me in my travels; he had loitered <br/>in forests, hid himself in caves or taken <br/>refuge in wide &amp; desart heaths &amp; he <br/>now came to view my progress &amp; claim <br/> <br/>the fulfill <br/>ment of  <br/>my promise; as I looked on him his countenance <br/> <br/>appeared to express the utmost extent
      of malice <br/>&amp; treachery. I thought with a sensation <br/>of  madness on my promise of crea <br/>ting another like to him &amp; trembling <br/>with passion  tore to pieces the thing <br/>on which I was engaged – The wretch <br/>saw me destroy the creature on whose <br/>future existence he depended for <br/>happiness and with a howl of devi <br/>lish despair &amp; revenge withdrew.</p><p> <br/>I left the room &amp; locking the door <br/>made a vow in my own heart never <br/>to resume my labours; &amp; then with trem <br/>bling steps I sought my own appartment <br/>I  was alone.  None were near me to <br/>dissipate the gloom and relieve me <br/>from the most terrible reveries. Several <br/>hours passed and I remained near my <br/>window gazing on the sea. It was almost <br/>motionless for the winds were hushed &amp;</p></div></body></html>
