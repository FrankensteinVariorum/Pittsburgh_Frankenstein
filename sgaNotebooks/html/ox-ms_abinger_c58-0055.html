No crimes no <br/>mischief, no malignity no misery can be  <br/>found parallell with mine. When I call over <br/>the frightful catalogue of my deeds I cannot <br/>believe that I am he, whose thoughts were once <br/>filled with sublime &amp; transcendent visions of <br/>the beauty &amp; the majesty of goodness – But <br/>it is even so – The fallen Angel becomes a <br/>malignant devil – Yet even that enemy of <br/>God &amp; man had friends &amp; associates in his <br/>desolation. I am quite alone.</p><p> <br/>You, who call Frankenstein your friend,
      seem <br/>to have a knowledge of my crimes &amp; his <br/>misfortunes. But in the detail which he <br/>gave you of them he could not sum up the <br/>hours &amp; months of misery which I endured <br/>wasting in impotent passions. For whilst I <br/>destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my <br/>own desires. They were forever ardent &amp; craving.</p></div></body></html>
