The desart mountains and mourful <br/>glaciers are my refuge—I have wandered <br/>here many days– The caves of ice which <br/>I only do not fear are a dwelling to me and <br/>the only one which man does not grudge <br/> — 
      – These bleak skies I  <br/>hail for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings <br/> <br/> <br/>If the <br/>multitude <br/>of mankind knew of my
      existence they would as youdo <br/>arm themselves for my destruction –  <br/>Shall I not then hate them who abhor me <br/>I will keep no  terms with my enemies  <br/>I am miserable &amp; they shall share my <br/>wretchedness– Yet it is in your power <br/>to recompense me and deliver them from <br/>an evil whichit <br/> only remains <br/>for you to <br/>make so <br/>great, that <br/>not only you <br/>&amp; your family <br/>but thousands <br/>of others shall <br/>be swallowed <br/>up in the <br/>whirlwinds of <br/>its rage.. <br/>Let your compassion and justice be <br/>moved and do not disdain me. Listen <br/>to my tale ! when you have heard that <br/>deny or comiserate me as you shall <br/>judge that I deserve–. But hear me –The <br/>guilty  are allowed by human laws, <br/>bloody as they may be, to speak in their own defence <br/>before they are condemned Listen to me
