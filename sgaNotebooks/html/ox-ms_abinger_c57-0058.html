      not <br/>know the names of the towns I was to pass <br/>through, nor could I ask information from <br/>a single human being – But I did not despair <br/>From you only could I hope for succour <br/>although towards you I felt no senti <br/>mentthat that of hate. – Unfeeling heartless <br/>creator! You had endowed me with percep <br/>tions and passions and then cast me <br/>abroard for the scorn &amp; horror of man <br/>kind —  But on you only had I any <br/>claim &amp; from you I determined to seek that <br/>justice  which I  vainly
      attempted <br/>to gain from  <br/>any other being <br/>that wore the human <br/>form. .</p><p> <br/>My travels were long and  the <br/> sufferings
      I endured intense –It was <br/>late in autumn when I quitted the <br/>district where I had so long resided –  <br/> I tra <br/>velled only at night, fearful of meeting <br/>the visage of a human being.—Nature <br/>decayed around me and the sun became <br/> heatless,—rain &amp;
        snow poured around me and I <br/>found no shelter — Oh Earth how often <br/>did I imprecate curses on the cause of <br/>my being— The mildness of  my nature <br/>had fled &amp; all within me was turned to gall <br/>&amp; bitterness –  <br/> the nearer I approached
      to your habi <br/>tation the more deeply did I feel the spirit <br/>of revenge become kind led in my heart—</p></div></body></html>
