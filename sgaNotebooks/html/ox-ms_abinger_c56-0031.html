I read with ardour  those books <br/>so full of genius and discrimination <br/> <br/>which modern <br/>enquirers on these sub- <br/>jects. I attended the lectures, and culti <br/>vated the acquaintance of the men <br/>of science of the university; and I found <br/>even in M<span class="underline hi"><span class="sup hi">r</span></span> Krempe a great deal <br/>of sound sense &amp; real information <br/>combined it is true with a repulsive <br/>phisiognomy &amp; manners, but not on <br/>that account the less valuable. <br/>In M. Waldman I found a true friend. <br/>His gentleness was never tinged by  <br/>dogmatism and his instructions were <br/>given with an air of frankness and <br/>good nature that banished every idea <br/>of  pedantry. It was perhaps the <br/>amiable character of this man that <br/>enclined me more to the study of that <br/>branch of natural philosophy which he professed than an intrinsic <br/>love for the science itself. But this <br/> only in the first steps towards the  <br/>knowledge; the more fully I entered  into <br/>science  the more I  pursued it <br/>for its own sake. That application <br/>which at first had been a matter <br/>of  duty &amp;
        resolution, now became so ardent <br/>and eager that the stars often <br/>dissapeared  <br/>in the light of <br/>morning while I was yet engaged <br/>in my labrotary.</p></div></body></html>
