We have been unfor <br/> <br/>tunate, and recent events have drawn us from that <br/>every day tranquillity  befitting my years

You are younger yet I do not suppose, possess <br/>ed as you are of a competent fortune that an early <br/>marriage would at all interfere with any future plans <br/>of honour and utilitythat you may have formed.  Do not suppose however that <br/>I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a <br/>delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasi <br/>ness; Interpeet my words with candour and answer <br/>me I conjure you with confidence and sincerity.</p><p> <br/>I listened to my father in silence and remained <br/>for sometime without offering any reply.

I was bound by <br/>a solemn promise which I had not yet fufilled and <br/>dared not break; or if I did what manifold mise <br/>ries might not impend over me and my devo <br/>ted family!  could I enter into a festival with <br/>this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and <br/>bowing me to the ground.  <br/>I must perform my engage <br/>ment and let the monster depart with his mate</p></div></body></html>
