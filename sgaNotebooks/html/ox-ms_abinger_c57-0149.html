I escaped from them to the room where lay the body <br/>of Elizabeth – my love — my wife – so lately <br/>living – so dear –so worthy – She had <br/>been moved from the posture in <br/>which I had first beheld her &amp; now <br/>as she lay her head upon her arm <br/>and  a hankerchief thrown across <br/>her face &amp; neck I might have sup <br/>posed her asleep – I rushed towards her &amp; <br/>embraced her with ardour but the <br/>deathly coldness of the body told me that <br/>what I now held in my arms had <br/>ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I <br/>had loved &amp; cherished, the murderous <br/>grasp of the fiend was on her neck <br/>&amp; the breath had ceased to issue from <br/>her  lips.</p><p> <br/>While I still held her in my arms <br/>in the agony of despair I happened to <br/>look up. The room  had before <br/>been quite dark and I felt a kind of <br/>panic on seeing the pale yellow light <br/>of the moon illuminate the chamber</p></div></body></html>
