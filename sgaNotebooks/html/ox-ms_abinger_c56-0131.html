      record are Chaldea <br/>and  India. Tradition has preserved wonderful accounts
      of their <br/>progress in astronomical science. To them we owe the Zodiac <br/>and many observations on the motions of the heavenly bodies  <br/>which argue a much more accurate knowledge of that art <br/>than any succeeding country could boast  uptil the time of Galileo <br/>and Newton. But their wisdom passed away from the earth leaving  faint <br/>traces  among the Eyptians a race of men
         whose <br/>minds bear a considerable affinity with those of the <br/>Chinese. Both these people arrived at a certain point in <br/>refinement and knowledge and remained fixed: Superstiti <br/>on and slavery clouded their perceptions and a hatred of <br/>innovation, the never-failing attendant on a mind <br/>which has learnt every thing from imitation and no- <br/>thing from itself, was the natural consequence of the  <br/>arbitrary  government they obeyed.
      Their history both on ac- <br/>count of its antiquity and the genius of the nation presents <br/>little more than a list of  names. Pride and a love of
      Con <br/>quest was the distinguishing characteristic of their kinds <br/>kings and  their magnificance was displayed either by a bloody <br/>and useless  warfare on the liberties of
      their neighbours <br/>or by the  oppression and  destruction of their own <br/>subjects employed in the building of those famous pyra <br/>mids, which,  being scarcely more than
      shapless masses <br/>of brick or stone, seem fitted to endure till the earth <br/>itself shall  be no longer.</p><p> <br/> The oppression of
      their own sovereigns fitted <br/>the necks of theEgyptians for the yoke of a foreign prince <br/>after a few generations they were subdued and remained for <br/>ages swallowed up in the great Persian monarchy till after the <br/>death of Alexander when they again
      became <br/>anindependant nation till the overpowering <br/>force of the Roman Empire reduced them once more to the <br/>condition of a Province. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/></p></div></body></html>
