As time passed away I became <br/>more calm; misery had her dwelling in my <br/>heart but I no longer talked in the same
      incoherent <br/>manner  of my own crimes; suffi <br/>cient for me was the consciousness of them. <br/>By the utmost self violence I curbed the <br/>imperious voice of wretchedness which <br/>desired sometimes to declare itself to the <br/>whole world, &amp; my manners were calmer <br/>&amp; more composed than they had ever been <br/>since my journey to the Sea of Ice. Even <br/>my father who watched me as the bird <br/>does its  nestling was deceived and thought <br/>that the black melancholy which had <br/>oppressed me was quitting me for ever <br/>and that my native country &amp; the society <br/>of my friends would entirely restore me to <br/>my former health &amp; vivacity.</p><p> <br/>We arrived at Havre on the 8<span class="underline hi"><span class="sup hi">th</span></span> <br/>of May &amp; instantly proceeded to Paris <br/>where my father had some business <br/>which detained us a few weeks.  <br/> In this city I received the <br/>following letter from Elizabeth:</p><p> <br/>To Victor Fankenstein <br/>May 18 – 17— <br/>My dearest Friend.</p></div></body></html>
