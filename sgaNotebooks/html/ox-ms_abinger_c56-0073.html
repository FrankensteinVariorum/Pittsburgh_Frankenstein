      day <br/> <br/>on which <br/>I should <br/>expect you – but that would be a cruel kindness <br/>and I dare not do it. What would be your <br/>surprise , my son, when
      your ex <br/>pected a happy and gay welcome to  <br/>beheld on the contrary tears and wretched <br/>ness. And how, Victor, can I relate our <br/>misfortune? absence cannot have rendered <br/>you callous to our joys and griefs and how <br/>can I inflict pain on an absent child.? <br/>I wish to prepare you for the woeful <br/>news but I know it is impossible; even <br/>now your eye skims over the page to <br/>seek the words which are to convey to <br/>you the horrible tidings.</p><p> <br/>William is dead! That sweet child <br/>whose smiles delighted &amp; warmed me <br/>who was so gentle yet so gay, Victor, he <br/>is Murdered!</p><p> <br/>I will not attempt to 
      console you <br/>but will simply relate the circumstances <br/>of the transaction.</p></div></body></html>
