No crea <br/>ture had ever been so miserable as I was <br/>so frightful an event was single upon <br/>earth.</p><p> <br/>But why should I dwell upon the <br/>incidents that followed this last over <br/>whelming event – Mine has been a tale <br/>horrors– I have  reached their acme <br/>and what I must now relate can but <br/>be tedious to you now that one by one <br/>my friends were snatched away &amp; I was <br/>left desolate. My own strength is exhausted <br/>&amp; I must tell in few words What remains <br/>of my hideous narration.</p><p> <br/>I arrived at Geneva. My fathe &amp; <br/>Ernest yet lived but the former was <br/>unable to bear the miserable tidings <br/>that I bore — I see him now excellent <br/>&amp; venerable old man – his eyes wandered <br/>in vacancy for they had lost their <br/>charm &amp; delight – his neice his more <br/>than daughter whom he doated on <br/>with all the affection of a man who <br/>in the decline of life having few affec <br/>tions clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed <br/>Cursed be the fiend that brought misery <br/>on his grey hairs &amp; doomed him to  <br/>waste <br/>in  wretchedness.
      He could not live <br/>under the horrors that were accumu- <br/>lated round him – An applapetic fit was <br/>brought on &amp; in a few days he died</p></div></body></html>
