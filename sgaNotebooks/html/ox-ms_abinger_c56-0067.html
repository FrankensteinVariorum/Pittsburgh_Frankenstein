      subject from <br/>my improvement, to the science itself, <br/>with  a desire as I evidently saw <br/>of drawing  me out.  <br/> <br/> What could I do? <br/>He meant to please  &amp; he <br/> <br/>tormented me I felt as if he  <br/> <br/>placed carefully one by one 
      in my <br/>view those instruments which were <br/> <br/>to be afterwards used in putting me to a <br/>slow and cruel  death. I writhed <br/>under his words, yet dared not shew <br/> the pain I felt. Clerval, whose <br/>eyes and feelings were always quick <br/>in discerning the sensations of others <br/>declined the subject alledging his <br/>ignorance &amp; the conversation took <br/>a more general turn. I thanked him <br/>from my heart, but I did not speak. <br/>I plainly saw that he was surprised, <br/>but he never attempted to draw <br/>my secret from me, and although <br/>I loved him with a mixture of <br/> <br/>affection and reverence that knew no <br/>bounds, yet I could never 
      persuade <br/>myself to confide to him that event <br/>which was so often present to my <br/>thoughts, but which I feared the detail <br/>to another would only impress more deeply.</p></div></body></html>
