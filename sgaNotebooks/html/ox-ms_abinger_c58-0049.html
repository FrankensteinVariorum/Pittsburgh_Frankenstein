Over him <br/>hung a form which I cannot find words to <br/>describe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth &amp; distor <br/>ted in its proportions. As he hung over the <br/>coffin his face was hid by long locks of ragged <br/>hair–  but one vast hand was
            extended, <br/>in colour &amp; apparent texture like that of a <br/>mummy. When he heard the sound of my <br/>approach; he ceased to utter exclamations of <br/>grief &amp; horror, &amp; sprung towards the window. <br/>Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his <br/>face, of  such loathsome yet apalling hideous <br/>-ness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, as <br/>recollecting what were my duties with respect <br/>to this destroyer, I called on him to stay. <br/>He paused – Looking on me with wonder, &amp; <br/>again turning towards the lifeless form of his <br/>creator he seemed to forget  my presence; <br/> and every feature &amp; gesture seemed
            instigated</p></div></body></html>
