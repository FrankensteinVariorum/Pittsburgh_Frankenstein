And do not think  that I <br/>shall be slow to perform that sacrifice <br/>I shall quit your vessel &amp; on the ice raft <br/>that brought me I shall seek  the most <br/>Northern extremity of land that the globe <br/>affords – I shall collect my funeral pile <br/>and consume myself to ashes – that my <br/>remains may afford no light to any <br/>curious &amp; unhallowed wretch who would <br/>create such another. I shall die. I shall <br/>no longer feel the anguish that now <br/>consumes me or be the prey of feelings <br/>unsatisfied yet unquenched. He is dead <br/>who created me and when I die the remem- <br/>brance of me will be lost for ever.  <br/> I shall no longer see the sun <br/>or stars or feel the winds play on my <br/>cheeks– Light feeling &amp; sense will die. <br/>And in this must I find my happiness. <br/>Some years ago when the images this <br/>world affords first opened on me <br/>when I felt the cheering warmth of sum <br/>mer &amp; heard the rustling of leaves &amp; <br/>the chirping of birds &amp; these were all <br/>to me I should have wept to die &amp; now <br/>it is my only consolation. Stained by crimes <br/>and torn by the bitterest remorse where <br/>can I find rest but in death.</p><p> <br/>Farewell; I leave you and with <br/>you the last of men that these eyes <br/>will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein</p></div></body></html>
