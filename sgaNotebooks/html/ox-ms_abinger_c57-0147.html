      resoldved <br/>that I would sell my life dearly &amp; <br/>not relax the conflict that impended untill  <br/>my own life, or that of my adversary were
        extinguished</p><p> <br/>Elizabeth observed my agitation for <br/>some time in timid &amp; fearful silence <br/>At length she said — What is it, my dear <br/>Victor, that agitates you? What is it <br/>you fear?</p><p> <br/>Oh peace, peace, my love, I replied, <br/>this night and all will be safe – but <br/>this night is dreadful very dreadful.</p></div></body></html>
