Do not deny me my <br/>request.</p><p> <br/>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought <br/>of the possible consequences of my consent <br/>but I felt that there was some justice <br/>in his argument. His tale and the fee <br/>lings he now expressed proved him to <br/>be a creature of fine sensations and <br/>did not I as his  maker owe him <br/>all the portion of happiness that it <br/>was in my power to bestow? He saw my <br/>change of feeling &amp; continued.</p><p> <br/>If you consent neither you or <br/>any human  creature shall ever
      see <br/>us again. I will go to the vast wilds of <br/>America. My food is not that of man; I <br/>do not destroy the lamb or the kid to <br/>glut my appetite. Acorns &amp; berries afford <br/>me sufficient nourishment. My com <br/>panion will be of the same nature <br/>as myself and will be content with <br/>the same fare. We shall make our bed <br/>of dried leaves; the sun will shine on <br/>us as on man &amp; will ripen our food. You <br/>are moved. The picture I present to you <br/>is peaceful &amp; human and you must <br/>feel that you could deny it only in <br/>the wantoness of power &amp; cruelty. Pitiless <br/>as you are towards me I see compassi <br/>on in your eyes. Let me seize the <br/>favourable moment &amp;  persuade <br/>you to promise what I so ardently <br/>desire.</p><p> <br/>You promise, replied I, to quit the habitations</p></div></body></html>
