And <br/>am I the only criminal while all man <br/>kind sinned against me? Why do you not <br/>hate Felix who drove his friend from his door <br/>or the man who would have destroyed <br/>the saviour of his child? Nay they are <br/>virtuous &amp; immalculate beings– While I the <br/>miserable &amp;  trampeled <br/>on, am an abortion to be spurned &amp; kicked <br/>&amp; hated!

I have <br/>seized the innocent as they slept and grasped <br/>his throat to death who never injured me. <br/>I devoted my creator to misery &amp; have follow <br/>ed him even to his 
      destruction – You hate <br/>me but your abhorrence cannot equal <br/>mine for myself–I look on my hands that <br/>executed the deed I think of the heart that <br/>formed the plans &amp; I loathe myself.</p></div></body></html>
