I who had ever been surrounded <br/>by amiable companions, continually <br/>engaged in  endeavouring to give <br/>mutual pleasure; I was now alone. <br/>In the university  whither I was <br/>going I must form my own friends <br/>and be my own protector. My <br/>life had hitherto been remarkably retired <br/>and domestic and this had given me <br/>an invincible repugnance to new  <br/>countenances. I loved my brothers Eliza- <br/>beth and Clerval these were "old <br/>familiar faces" but I believed my <br/>self totally unfitted for the compa- <br/>ny of strangers.

I ardently desired knowledge <br/> <br/>I had often when at home <br/>thought it hard  to remain <br/> <br/>during my youth cooped up in one place  <br/> and had
