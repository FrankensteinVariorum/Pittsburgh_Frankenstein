      presence of the <br/>Magistrate; an old benevolent man with <br/>calm &amp; mild manners. He looked upon me <br/>however with some degree of severity, and then <br/>turning towards my conductors  he  asked who <br/> appeared as wit- <br/>nesses on this occasion. about half a dozen <br/>men came forward and one being selected <br/>by the magistrate he deposed that he had been <br/>out fishing the night before with his son &amp; <br/>his brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when <br/>about nine o clock they observed a strong <br/>northerly blast rising &amp; they accordingly put <br/>in for port. It was a very dark night as <br/>the moon had not yet risen; They did not <br/>land at the harbour but, as they had been <br/>accustomed, at a creek about two miles <br/>below. He went first carrying a part <br/>of the fishing tackle &amp; his companions <br/>followed him at some distance. As he <br/>was walking along the sands he struck his foot <br/>against somthing &amp; fell all his length on <br/>the ground; his comrades came up to assist <br/>him &amp; by the light of their lantern they <br/>discovered that he had fallen on the <br/>body of a man who was to all appearance <br/>dead.</p><p> <br/>Their first supposition was that <br/>it was the corpse of some person who had been <br/>drowned &amp; thrown on shore by the waves, <br/>But upon examination they found that <br/>the clothes were not wet &amp; even that the body <br/>was not yet cold. They instantly carried <br/>it to the cottage of an old woman <br/>near the spot &amp; endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life </p></div></body></html>
