      thus <br/>with life? Do your duty towards me <br/>and I will do mine towards you &amp; <br/>the rest of mankind. If you comply with my conditions –I will leave
      them <br/>and you at peace –  <br/> <br/>but if you refuse I will glut the  maw of
      death untill <br/>it
      be  satiated even with your <br/>dearest friends."</p><p> <br/>" Abhorred monster, <br/>cried I furiously, fiend that thou art <br/>the tortures of Hell are too  <br/>mild a <br/>vengeance for <br/>thy crimes. <br/>wretched devil! you reproach me <br/>with your creation; come, that I may <br/>extinguish the spark that I so negli <br/>gently bestowed." My rage was without <br/>bounds I sprung on him  <br/> impelled by all the feelings which can arm one <br/> being against <br/>the existence <br/>of another. <br/>He eluded me easily, and said – Be calm!
      I entreat <br/> you to hear me, before you give vent <br/>to your hatred upon my devoted head–. Have <br/>I not suffered enough that you <br/> wish to encrease my misery–Life <br/>although it be only an accumulation <br/>of anguish is dear to me and I will defend <br/>it remember thou hast made me more</p></div></body></html>
