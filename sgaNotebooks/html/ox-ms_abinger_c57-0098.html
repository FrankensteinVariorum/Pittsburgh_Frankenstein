Sometimes I thought that the <br/>fiend followed me &amp; might remind me <br/>by murdering my companion; When these <br/>thoughts I would not quit Henry for a <br/>moment but followed him as his shadow <br/>to protect him from the fancied rage <br/>of his destroyer. I felt as if I had commit <br/>ted some great crime the conscious <br/>ness of which haunted me. I was guiltless <br/>but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse <br/>uponmy head as mortal as that of
        crime <br/>.</p><p> <br/>I visited Edinburgh with languid <br/>eyes &amp; mind &amp; yet that city might have <br/>interrested the most unfortunate being. <br/>Clerval did not like it so well as <br/>Oxford for the antiquity of thelatter city was <br/>pleasing to him. But the beauty &amp; regu <br/>larity of the new town of Edinburgh delighted him; its <br/>environs are also the most beautiful <br/>in the world; Arthur's seat, St Bernards <br/>Well &amp; the Pentland hillsâ€“ But I was im <br/>patient to arrive at the termination <br/>of my journey.  We left Edinburgh in <br/>a week passing through Cooper, St Andrews <br/>&amp; Along the the banks of the Tay to Perth <br/>Where our friend expected us; But I was <br/>not in the mood to laugh &amp; talk with  <br/>Strangers or enter into their feelings or plans</p></div></body></html>
