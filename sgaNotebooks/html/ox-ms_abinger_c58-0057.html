I look <br/> the hands which executed that deed, I think <br/> the heart in which the imagination of it was <br/>ncieved, &amp; long for the moment when they will <br/>eet my eyes, when it will haunt my thoughts <br/>o more.</p><p> <br/>Fear not that I shall be the
      instrument of <br/>uture mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither <br/>ours nor any mans death is needed to consum- <br/>mate the series of my being, &amp; accomplish that <br/>which must be done; but it requires my own. <br/>Do not fear that I shall be slow to perform <br/>this sacrifize. I shall quit your vessel on the <br/>ice-raft which brought me hither; &amp; shall <br/>seek with rapid steps, the most northern ex- <br/>-tremity of the globe. I shall collect my funeral <br/>pile, &amp; consume to ashes this miserable frame, <br/>that its remains may afford no light to any <br/>curious &amp; unhallowed wretch who would create such <br/>another as I have been. I shall die. I shall <br/>no longer feel the agonies which now consume</p></div></body></html>
