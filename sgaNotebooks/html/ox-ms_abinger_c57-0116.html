      from <br/>fatigue &amp; hunger, but being surrounded by <br/>a croud I thought it politic to rouse all <br/>my strength that no physical debility
      might <br/>be construed into apprehension  or cons <br/>cious guilt. Little did I then expect the <br/>calamity that would in a few moments <br/>overwhelm me, and extinguish in horror &amp; despair <br/> all fear of ignominy or death— <br/> I must pause  <br/>for it requires <br/> <br/> to recall the frightful images of the events which <br/> I am about <br/>to relate in in <br/>proper detail to my recollection.</p></div></body></html>
