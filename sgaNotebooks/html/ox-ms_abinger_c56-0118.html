At other <br/>times I spurred on the animal before <br/>my companions that I might forget <br/>them, the world, and more than <br/>all myself. When at a distance I <br/>alighted and threw myself on <br/>the grass  weighed down <br/>by horror &amp; despair. At eight in <br/>the evening we arrived at Chamou <br/>nix. My father &amp; Elizabeth were very much fatigued. <br/> Ernest who accompanied us was <br/>delighted and in high spirits– The <br/>only circumstance that detracted <br/>from his pleasure was the south wind <br/>and the rain that that wind seemed <br/>to promise  for the next day.</p><p> <br/>We retired early to our appartments <br/>but not to sleep:– at least I did not. I <br/>remained many hours at the window <br/>watching the pallid lightning that played <br/>above Mont Blanc – and listening <br/>to the rushing of the Arve which <br/>ran before my window.</p></div></body></html>
