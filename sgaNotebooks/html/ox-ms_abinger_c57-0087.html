After some days spent in <br/>listless indolence during which I  <br/>traversed many leagues I arrived at <br/>Strasburgh where I waited two days <br/>for Clerval. He came;  alas, how great <br/>was the contrast between us. He was <br/>alive to every new scene; joyful when <br/>he saw the beauties of the settingsun and <br/>more happy when he saw it rise &amp; <br/>recommence a new day. He pointed <br/>out to me the shifting colours  of
      the <br/>landscape &amp; the appearances of the <br/>sky. This
      is what it is to live, he cried, <br/>now I enjoy existence. But you, my <br/>dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding &amp; <br/>sorrowful?" Indeed I was occupied by <br/>gloomy thoughts and neither saw <br/>the descent of the evening star nor the <br/>golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine; <br/>and you, my friend, would be far more <br/>amused with the journal of Clerval <br/>who observed the scenery with an <br/>eye of feeling &amp; delight, than to listen <br/>to my reflections; I, a miserable wretch <br/>haunted by a curse that shut up every <br/>avenue to enjoyment.</p><p> <br/>We had agreed to go down the Rhine <br/>in a boat from Strasbourgh to Rotterdam</p></div></body></html>
