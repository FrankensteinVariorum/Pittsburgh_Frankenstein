At length I gathered <br/>resolution to speak, in a pause as it were in <br/>the tempest of his passion — Your repentance is <br/>now superflous: I said, If you had listened to <br/>the voice of conscience, &amp; heeded the stings of <br/>remorse before you had urged your diabolical <br/>vengeance to this extremity; Frankenstein would <br/>yet have lived.</p><p> <br/>And do you dream — said the Dæmon,
      do <br/>you think that I was then dead to agony &amp; <br/>remorse. – He– he  p continued, pointing
      to <br/>the corpse, he suffered not more in consum <br/>-mation of the deed; oh not the ten thousandth <br/>portion of the anguish that was mine during <br/>the lingering detail of its execution. A frigh- <br/>-tful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart <br/>was poisoned with remorse. Think ye that <br/>the groans of Clerval were music to my ear. <br/>My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of <br/>love &amp; sympathy, &amp; when wrenched by misery <br/>to vice &amp; hatred it did not endure the <br/>violence of the change without torture</p></div></body></html>
