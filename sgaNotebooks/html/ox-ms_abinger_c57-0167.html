      dread for my <br/>task is unfulfilled. Oh when will my gui <br/>ding  spirit in conducting me <br/>to him allow me the rest I so much desire! <br/>or must I die &amp; he yet live—If I do swear <br/>to me, Walton, that he shall not escape <br/>that you will seek him &amp; satisfy my <br/>vengeance in his death. Yet do I dare <br/>ask you to undertake my pilgrimage to <br/>endure the hardships that I have un <br/>dergone. No I am not so selfish– yet <br/>When I am dead if he should appear <br/>if the ministers of vengeance should <br/>conduct him to you  <br/> Swear that he shall <br/>not live – Swear that  <br/>he shall not triumph over my accu <br/>mulated miseries &amp; live to make a <br/>nother such a wretch as I am – Oh he <br/>is eloquent &amp; persuasive and once <br/>his words had even power over <br/>my heart but trust him not– His soul <br/>is hellish as his form full of treachery &amp; fiend like <br/>malice– hear him not, call on the <br/>manes of William, Justine, Clerval <br/>Elizabeth, my father and of the Whretch- <br/>ed Victor &amp; thrust your swordinto his <br/>heart–  <br/>I will hover near you &amp; direct the steel <br/>aright </p></div></body></html>
