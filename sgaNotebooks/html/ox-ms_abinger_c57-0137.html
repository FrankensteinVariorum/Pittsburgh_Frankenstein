But it is your hap <br/>piness I desire as well as my own  <br/>when I declare to you that our marriage <br/>would render me eternally miserable <br/>unless it were the dictate of your own <br/>free choice. Even now I weep when I  think <br/>that borne down as you are by the <br/>cruellest misfortunes you may stifle <br/>by the word honor all hope of that <br/>love &amp; happiness which would alone <br/>restore you to yourself. I who have <br/>so disinterrested an affection for you <br/>may encrease your miseries tenfold <br/>by being an obstacle to your wishes <br/>Ah Victor be assured that your cou <br/>sin &amp; playmate has too sincere <br/>a love for you not to be made <br/>wretched by this supposition. Be hap <br/>py my friend and if you obey me in <br/>this one request be assured that <br/>nothing on earth will have the power <br/>to interrupt my tranquillity.</p><p> <br/>Do not let this letter disturb you. <br/>Do  not answer it tomorrow or the <br/>next day or not even untill you <br/>come if it will give you pain. My <br/>Uncle will send me news of your <br/>health and if I see but one smile <br/>on your lips when we meet occa <br/>sioned by this letter or any other <br/>exertion of mine I shall need no <br/>other happinessâ€“ Your affectionate friend <br/>Elizabeth Lavenza. <br/>Geneva</p></div></body></html>
