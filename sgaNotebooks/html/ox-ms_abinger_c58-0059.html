Soon these burning miseries will <br/>be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly; <br/>&amp; exult in the agony of the torturing flames. <br/>The light of that conflagration will fade away. <br/> My ashes
      will be swept into the sea <br/>by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace; <br/>or if it thinks will surely not think thus. <br/>Adieu.</p><p> <br/>He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, <br/>upon an ice raft which lay close to the vessel; <br/>he was soon borne away by the waves, &amp; lost <br/>in the darkness of distance.</p></div></body></html>
