I should travel <br/>to Strasburgh where Clerval would <br/>join me and we should proceed down <br/>the Rhine together. Some short time <br/>would be spent in the towns of Holland <br/>but our principal stay would be in England. <br/> We should return by France â€“ &amp;  it <br/> was agreed that this tour should occu <br/> py the space of two years.</p><p> <br/>My father pleased himself <br/>with the reflection that I should <br/>be united to Elizabeth immediately <br/>on my return to Geneva. These two <br/>years, said he, will pass swiftly and <br/>it will be the last delay that <br/>will oppose itself to your happi <br/>ness. And indeed I earnestly desire <br/>that period to arrive when we <br/>shall all be united and neither hopes <br/>or fears arise to disturb our domes <br/>tic  calm.</p><p> <br/>I am content, I replied with <br/>your arrangement. By that time <br/>we shall both have  become wiser <br/>and I hope happier than we at present are </p></div></body></html>
