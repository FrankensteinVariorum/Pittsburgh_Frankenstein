Something whispers to me not to depend <br/>too much on the prospect that is opened before us <br/>but I will not  listen to such a sinister voice. <br/>Observe how fast we move along, and how the clouds <br/>which sometimes obscure, and sometimes rise above <br/>the dome of Mônt Blânc, under this scene of <br/>beauty still more interesting.
