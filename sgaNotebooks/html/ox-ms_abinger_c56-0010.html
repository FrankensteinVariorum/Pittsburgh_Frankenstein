        accident prevented my attending the  these
        lectures <br/>until  it was nearly finihsed. The <br/>lecture which I attended being thus  almost the last  in his course was entirely incomprehensible to me. – the professor talked <br/>with the greatest fluency of potassium &amp; <br/>Boron  – of sulphats and oxids <br/>terms to which <br/>I could  affix no idea:  I was <br/>disgusted with  a science <br/>that appeared to me to contain only words.</p><p> <br/>From this time untill I went to <br/>Colledge I entirely neglected my formerly <br/>adored study of the science of natural philosophy although I still <br/>read with delight Pliny and Buffons <br/>authors  <br/>in my estimation of nearly equal interest &amp;
        utility.</p><p> <br/>My occupations at this age were  principally the <br/>mathematics,  and most <br/>of the branches of study appertaining  to that <br/>science. I was also busily employed in learning <br/>languages Latin was already familiar to me and I began to <br/>read without the help of the lexicon some of the <br/>easiest greek authors. –I also understood English
      &amp; <br/>german perfectly: this
        
        is
       list of my accom- <br/>plishments at  the age of and you may <br/>conceive that my hours were fully employd <br/>in acquiring and maintaining a knowledge <br/> of this various literature.</p></div></body></html>
