      ungazed at <br/>and unmolested, hardly thanked for the <br/>pittance of food and clothes which I gave <br/>so much does suffering blunt even <br/>the coarsest sensations of men.</p><p> <br/></p><p> <br/>In this retreat I devoted the mor <br/>ning to labour, but in the evening, <br/>when the weather permitted I walked <br/>on the stony beach of the sea to listen <br/>to the waves as they roared &amp; dashed at <br/>my feet; It was a monotonous yet <br/>ever changing scene. I thought of Swit <br/>zerland; It was far different from <br/>this desolate &amp; appalling landscape –Its <br/>hills are covered with vines &amp; its <br/>cottages are scattered thickly in the <br/>plains— Its fair lakes reflect a <br/>blue &amp; gentle sky &amp; when troubled <br/>by the winds it is but the play of <br/>a lively infant when compared <br/>to the roarings of the giant ocean.</p><p> <br/>Inthis  manner I <br/>distributed my occupations when I first <br/>arrived; but as I proceeded in my work it <br/>became every day more horrible &amp; irksome <br/>to me. Sometimes I could  not prevail <br/>on myself to enter my laboratory for several <br/>days and at other times I toiled day &amp; <br/>night in order to complete it. It was indeed <br/>a  filthy work in which I was
      en- <br/>gaged. During my first experiment a kind of <br/>enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the <br/>horror of my employment; my mind was <br/>intently fixed on the sequel of my labour</p></div></body></html>
