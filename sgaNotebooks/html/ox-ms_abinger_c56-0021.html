He bitterly la <br/>mented that he was unable to <br/>accompany me But his father <br/>could not be persuaded to part with him <br/> intendingthat he should be- <br/>come a partner with him in <br/>his business, and  <br/> in <br/>compliance <br/>with his favou <br/>rite theory, <br/>that  learning <br/>was superflous <br/>in the com- <br/>-merce of ordi <br/>nary life. <br/> <br/> Henry had a refined mind <br/> he had no desire to be idle <br/>and was well pleased to become  <br/> his father's partnerbut he believed <br/>that a man might be a very good <br/>trader and yet posess a cultivated <br/>understanding.</p><p> <br/>We sate late listening to his com <br/>plaints, and  making many little <br/>arrangements for the future. The <br/>next morning early I departed. Tears <br/>gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth <br/>they proceeded partly from sorrow <br/>at my departure, and partly because <br/>she reflected that the same journey <br/>was to have taken place three <br/>months before when a mothers <br/>blessing would have accompanied me</p></div></body></html>
