      our union <br/>had been the favourite plan of my aunt <br/>and uncle ever since our infancy–We were <br/>told this when young and taught to look <br/>forward to it as an event that would <br/>certainly take place. We were affectionate <br/>playfellows during childhood &amp; I believe <br/>dear &amp; valued friends to one another when <br/>we grew older. But as a brother &amp; sister <br/>often entertain a lively affection towards <br/>one another without desiring a more intimate union may not such also be <br/>our case. Tell me, dearest Victor, Answer <br/>me, I conjure you by our mutual happi <br/>ness, with simple truth do you not love <br/> <br/>another?</p><p> <br/>You have travelled, you have spent <br/> <br/>several years of your life at Ingolstadt–&amp; <br/>I confess to  you, my friend that when <br/>I saw you last Autumn so unhappy <br/> flying from the society <br/>of every creature to solitude &amp; despon <br/>dency I could not help supposing <br/>that you might regret our connection <br/>&amp; believe your self bound in honour <br/>to fulfil the wishes of your parents <br/>although they opposed themselves to <br/>your inclinations. But this is false <br/>resoning.  I confess to you my <br/>cousin that I  love you &amp; <br/>that in my airy castles of futurity <br/>you have been my constant friend</p></div></body></html>
