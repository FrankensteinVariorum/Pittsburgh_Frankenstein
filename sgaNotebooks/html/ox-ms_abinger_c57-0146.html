The  <br/>Alps <br/>here come closer to the lake &amp; we approach <br/>ed the amphitheatre of mountains that <br/>forms its eastern boundary. The spire <br/>of Evian shone under the woods that <br/>surrounded it &amp; the range of mountain <br/>above mountain by which it was overhung .</p><p> <br/>The wind which had hitherto carried <br/>us along with amazing rapidity sunk <br/>at sunset to a gentle breeze â€“ the light <br/>air just ruffled the water &amp; caused a <br/>pleasant motion among the trees. As we <br/>approached the shore it wafted the <br/>most delightful scent of flowers &amp; hay. <br/>The  sun sunk beneath the horizon <br/>as we landed and as I touched the shore <br/>I felt those cares and fears revive <br/>which soon were to clasp me &amp;
        cling to me <br/>forever.</p></div></body></html>
