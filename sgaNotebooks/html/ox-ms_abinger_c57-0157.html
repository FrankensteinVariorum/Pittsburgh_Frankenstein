      calculating <br/>and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death <br/>would have been my portion. My first resolution was <br/>to quit Geneva for ever.– My country which when <br/>I was happy &amp; beloved was dear me now in my adversity became hateful <br/>I provided myself with a small sum of money <br/> <br/>together <br/>with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother <br/>&amp;  departed</p><p> <br/>And now my wanderings began which are to <br/>cease but with life – I have traversed a vast <br/>portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships <br/>which travellers in desarts &amp; barbarous countries <br/>are wont to meet – How I have lived I hardly know <br/> many times have I  stretched my failing limbs on the sandy plain <br/>exhausted &amp; far from succour, &amp; prayed for <br/>death – But revenge kept me alive – I dared <br/>not die &amp; leave my adversary in being.—</p><p> <br/>When I quitted Geneva my first  labour <br/>was to gain some clue by which I might trace <br/>the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled and I <br/>wandered many hours around the confines <br/>of the town uncertain what path I should pursue <br/>As night approached I found myself at the <br/>entrance of the cemetary, where William, Eliza <br/>beth and my father reposed – I entered it &amp; <br/>approached the  tomb which marked
      their <br/>graves. Every thing was silent except the <br/>leaves of the trees which were gentlyagitated by the <br/>breeze — The night was nearly dark and the <br/>scene would have been even to an unin <br/>terested observeraffecting and solemn–the <br/>spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a <br/> <br/>shadow <br/>which <br/>was felt but seen notaround the head of the mourner.
