        with <br/> more than <br/>mortal speed.</p><p> <br/>I persued him;– &amp; for many months this <br/> <br/>pursuit has been my task. Guided by a slight clue <br/>I  followed the windings of the Rhone <br/>but vainly – The mediterranean appeared <br/>and by a strange chance I saw the fiend <br/>enter by night &amp; hide himself in a vessel <br/>bound for the black sea – I followed him  <br/>I knew the <br/>vessel in which <br/>he was concealed <br/>&amp; he escaped me <br/>I know not <br/>how. <br/> Amidst the wilds of Tartary
      &amp; <br/>Russia although he still evaded me <br/>I have ever followed in his track – Some <br/>times the peasants scared by his horrid <br/>Apparition informed me of his path <br/>Sometimes he himself who feared that <br/>if I lost all trace I should despair &amp; die <br/>often left some mark to guide me –The <br/>snows descended on my head &amp; I saw the print <br/>of his huge step on the white plain –To <br/>you are fast enterring on life, &amp; care is new to you &amp; how can <br/>you understand what I have felt &amp; still feel. <br/>Cold, want &amp; fatigue were the least pains  <br/>which I was <br/>destined to endure; <br/>I was cursed by some devil &amp; bore about <br/>with me my eternal Hell – Yet still a <br/>spirit of good followed &amp; directed my steps</p></div></body></html>
