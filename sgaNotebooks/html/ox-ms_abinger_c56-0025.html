W.aldham a fellow professor <br/>would lecture upon chemistry <br/>the alternate days which he missed.</p><p> <br/>I returned home not dissapointed <br/>for I had long considered the au- <br/>thors useless which the professor <br/>had so strongly reprobated â€“ but I <br/>did not feel very much enclined <br/>to  study those books which at <br/>his  recommondation I had <br/>procured.
