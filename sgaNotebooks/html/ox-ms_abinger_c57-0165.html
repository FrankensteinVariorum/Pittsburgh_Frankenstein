      expance <br/>before, with anguish; when suddenly my eye was <br/>arrested by a dark speck on the dusky plain – I strained my <br/>sight to discover what  it could be &amp; uttered a wild <br/>cry of extacy when I distinguished a sledge dogs &amp; <br/>the distorted proportions of a well known form within. Oh  with what <br/>a burning gush did hope revisit my heart – warm <br/>tears filled my eyes which I hastily wiped away <br/>that they might not  intercept the view I had of the <br/>fiend. I followed— but still the dew dimmed my <br/>sight untill giving way to the emotions that <br/>oppressed me I wept aloud.</p><p> <br/>But this was not the time for delay <br/>I disincumbered the dogs of their dead compa <br/>nion  gave them a plentiful portion of <br/>food and after an hours repose which was abso <br/>lutely necessary &amp; yet which was bitterly irksome <br/>to me I continued my path — The sledge was <br/>still visible nor did I again lose sight of it <br/>except at the moments when for a short time <br/>some ice rock concealed it  with its
          intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly <br/>gained on the object of my pursuit. And after about  ano <br/>ther days journey I beheld myself at no <br/>more than half a 
          mile distant.  <br/>My heart bounded within me – But <br/>now when I appeared almost within grasp <br/>of my enemy my hopes were suddenly extinguished <br/>and I  lost all trace of him more <br/>utterly than I had ever done before A ground <br/>sea was heard – the thunder of itsprogress as  the wa <br/>ters rolled &amp; swelled beneath me became every <br/>moment more ominous &amp; terrific —I pressed
      on <br/> but in
        vain – The wind arose the sea roared</p></div></body></html>
