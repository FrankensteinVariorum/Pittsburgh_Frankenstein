You hate me but your abhorrence cannot <lb/><damage/>al that with which I regard myself. I look <lb/><damage/> the hands which executed that deed, I think <lb/><damage/> the heart in which the imagination of it was <lb/><damage/>ncieved, &amp; long for the moment when they will <lb/><damage/>eet my eyes, when it will haunt my thoughts <lb/><damage/>o more.</p><p> <lb/>Fear not that I shall be the
      instrument of <lb/><damage/>uture mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither <lb/><damage/>ours nor any mans death is needed to consum- <lb/><damage/>mate the series of my being, &amp; accomplish that <lb/>which must be done; but it requires my own. <lb/>Do not fear that I shall be slow to perform <lb/>this sacrifize. I shall quit your vessel on the <lb/>ice-raft which brought me hither; &amp; shall <lb/>seek with rapid steps, the most northern ex- <lb/>-tremity of the globe. I shall collect my funeral <lb/>pile, &amp; consume to ashes this miserable frame, <lb/>that its remains may afford no light to any <lb/>curious &amp; unhallowed <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>wretch who would create such <lb/>another as I have been. I shall die. I shall <lb/>no longer feel the agonies which now consume</p></ab>
