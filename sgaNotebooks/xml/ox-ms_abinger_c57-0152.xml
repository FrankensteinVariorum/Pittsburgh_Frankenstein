No crea <lb/>ture had ever been so miserable as I was <lb/>so frightful an event was single upon <lb/>earth.</p><p> <lb/>But why should I dwell upon the <lb/>incidents that followed this last over <lb/>whelming event – Mine has been a tale <lb/>horrors– I have  reached their acme <lb/>and what I must now relate can but <lb/>be tedious to you now that one by one <lb/>my friends were snatched away &amp; I was <lb/>left desolate. My own strength is exhausted <lb/>&amp; I must tell in few words What remains <lb/>of my hideous narration.</p><p> <lb/>I arrived at Geneva. My fathe &amp; <lb/>Ernest yet lived but the former was <lb/>unable to bear the miserable tidings <lb/>that I bore — I see him now excellent <lb/>&amp; venerable old man – his eyes wandered <lb/>in vacancy for they had lost their <lb/>charm &amp; delight – his neice his more <lb/>than daughter whom he doated on <lb/>with all the affection of a man who <lb/>in the decline of life having few affec <lb/>tions clings <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed <lb/>Cursed be the fiend that brought misery <lb/>on his grey hairs &amp; doomed him to  <lb/>waste <lb/>in  wretchedness.
      He could not live <lb/>under the horrors that were accumu- <lb/>lated round him – An applapetic fit was <lb/>brought on &amp; in a few <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>days he died</p></ab>
