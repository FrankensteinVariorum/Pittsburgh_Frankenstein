Oh how I hate all its shews <lb/>and mockeries.– When one creature is <lb/>murderedanother is immediately  <lb/>deprive of life in a slow torturing <lb/>manner &amp; <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>then the executioners their hands yet reeking
          with the blood of innocence believe that they have done <lb/>a great deed. They call this retribution; hate <lb/>ful name! When that <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>word is pronounced <lb/>I know that greater and more horrid <lb/>punishments are going to be inflicted <lb/>than the gloomiest tyrant has <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>ever in <lb/>ventented to satiatehis utmost revenge. Yet this <lb/>is not consolation <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>for you, my Justine, <lb/>unless indeed that you may glory <lb/>in escaping so miserable a den. Alas! <lb/>I would I were <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>in peace with my aunt &amp; my <lb/>sweet William –  escaped <lb/>from light which is hateful to me and the <lb/>visages of men which  <lb/>" I abhor.</p><p> <lb/>Justine smiled languidly. "This, dear Lady <lb/>said she is despair and not resignation. <lb/>I must not learn the lesson that you <lb/>would teach me – talk of somthing else <lb/> of something that will  <lb/>bring joy and not encrease of misery."</p></ab>
