      "To <lb/>"have gained a  desciple and if if your <lb/>" application equals your ability <lb/>"I have no doubt of your success. Che <lb/>"mistry is that branch of natural <lb/>"philosophy in which the greatest im- <lb/>"provements have <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>been &amp; may be made. <lb/>"It is on that account that I
      <unclear>sl</unclear> <lb/>"chose it for my peculiar study. But <lb/>"at the same <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>time I did not neglect the <lb/>"other sciences. A man would make <lb/>"a very sorry chemist if he atteneded <lb/>to that department alone. <unclear unit="chars" extent="1"/> If <lb/>"your wish is really to become a <lb/>"man of science and not merely <lb/>"a pretty experimentalist I should <lb/>"advise you to apply to every <lb/>"branch of natural philosophy  <lb/><retrace cause="fix" hand="#mws">including</retrace> <lb/>"Mathematics."</p><p> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/></p><p> <lb/>He then took me into his <lb/>laboratory and
