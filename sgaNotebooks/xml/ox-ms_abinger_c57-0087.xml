After some days spent in <lb/>listless indolence during which I  <lb/>traversed many leagues I arrived at <lb/>Strasburgh where I waited two days <lb/>for Clerval. He came;  alas, how great <lb/>was the contrast between us. He was <lb/>alive to every new scene; joyful when <lb/>he saw the beauties of the setting<metamark function="insert">^</metamark>sun and <lb/>more happy when he saw it rise &amp; <lb/>recommence a new day. He pointed <lb/>out to me the shifting colours  of
      the <lb/>landscape &amp; the appearances of the <lb/>sky. <restore type="smear_strikethrough"/>This
