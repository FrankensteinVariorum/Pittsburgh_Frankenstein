Over him <lb/>hung a form which I cannot find words to <lb/>describe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth &amp; distor <lb/>ted in its proportions. As he hung over the <lb/>coffin his face was hid by long locks of ragged <lb/>hair–  but one vast hand was
            extended, <lb/>in colour &amp; apparent texture like that of a <lb/>mummy. When he heard the sound of my <lb/>approach; he ceased to utter exclamations of <lb/>grief &amp; horror, &amp; sprung towards the window. <lb/>Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his <lb/>face, of  such loathsome yet apalling hideous <lb/>-ness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, as <lb/>recollecting what were my duties with respect <lb/>to this destroyer, I called on him to stay. <lb/>He paused – Looking on me with wonder, &amp; <lb/>again turning towards the lifeless form of his <lb/>creator he seemed to forget  my presence; <lb/> and every feature &amp; gesture seemed
            instigated</p></ab>
