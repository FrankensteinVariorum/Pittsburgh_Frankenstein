      strange <lb/>chances that have lately  occurred. <lb/>You were thrown, by some surprising <lb/>accident, on this shore, renowned for its <lb/>hospitality  <lb/>Siezed immediately &amp; charged with murder <lb/>the first sight that was presented to your <lb/>eyes was the body of your friend mur <lb/>dered in so unaccountable a manner <lb/>and placed by some fiend as it were across <lb/>your path— </p><p> <lb/>As M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Kirwin said this,
      notwithstanding <lb/>the agitation that I  endured on this <lb/>retrospect of my sufferings–I also felt <lb/>considerable surprise at the knowledge <lb/>he seemed to possess concerning me. <lb/>I suppose some astonishment was expressed <lb/>in my countenance – for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Kirwin <lb/>hastened to say – It was not untill a day <lb/>or two after your illness that I thought <lb/>of examining your dress that I might <lb/>discover some trace by which I could <lb/>send to your relations an account of your <lb/>misfortune and illness. I found several letters <lb/>among others one <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>which I discovered by its commence <lb/>ment to be from your father – I instant <lb/>ly wrote to Geneva – nearly two months has <lb/>passed since the departure of my letter — <lb/>But you are ill – even now you tremble <lb/> <lb/>You appear unfit for agitation of any kind.</p><p> <lb/>This suspence,  is
      a thousand <lb/>times worse than the most horrible <lb/>event –Tell me what new scene of death <lb/>has been acted &amp; whose murder I am <lb/>now to lament.</p></ab>
