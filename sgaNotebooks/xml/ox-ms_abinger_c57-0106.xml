I have en <lb/>dured incalculable fatigue &amp; cold &amp; hunger  <lb/>do you dare destroy my hopes?</p><p> <lb/>Begone, I replied; I do break my  <lb/>promise; never will create another like <lb/>yourself, equal in deformity &amp; wickedness.</p><p> <lb/>Slave, said the wretch, I before <lb/>reasoned with you – but you have proved <lb/>yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remem <lb/>ber that I have power; you believe your <lb/>self miserable but I can make you so <lb/>wretched that the light of day  will <lb/>be hateful to you. You are my creator <lb/>but I am your master; obey!</p><p> <lb/>Wretch, said I, the hour of my weak- <lb/>ness is past &amp; the period of your power is <lb/>arrived. Your threats cannot move me <lb/>to do an act of wickedness but they confirm <lb/>me in a resolution of not creating you <lb/>companion in vice. Shall I in cold blood <lb/>set loose upon the earth a dæmon <lb/>whose delight is in death &amp; wretchedness. <lb/>Begone, I am firm and your words will <lb/>only exasperate my rage.</p><p> <lb/>The Monster saw my determination <lb/>in my face and gnashed his teeth in the <lb/>impotence of anger. Shall each man, cried <lb/>he, find his equal, &amp; each beast have <lb/>his mate  and I be alone. I had feelings <lb/>of affection &amp; they were returned by detes <lb/>tation. Man you may hate, but beware!</p></ab>
