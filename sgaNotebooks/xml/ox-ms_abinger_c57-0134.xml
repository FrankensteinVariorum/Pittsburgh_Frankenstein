As time passed away I became <lb/>more calm; misery had her dwelling in my <lb/>heart but I no longer talked in the same

Even <lb/>my father who watched me as the bird <lb/>does its  nestling was deceived and thought <lb/>that the black melancholy which had <lb/>oppressed me was quitting me for ever <lb/>and that my native country &amp; the society <lb/>of my friends would entirely restore me to <lb/>my former health &amp; vivacity.</p><p> <lb/>We arrived at Havre on the 8<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> <lb/>of May &amp; instantly proceeded to Paris <lb/>where my father had some business <lb/>which detained <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>us a few weeks.  <lb/> In this city I received the <lb/>following letter from Elizabeth:</p><p> <lb/>To Victor Fankenstein <lb/>May 1<damage type="inkblot">8</damage> – 17— <lb/>My dearest Friend.</p></ab>
