Besides, they observed, <lb/>that it appeared I had brought the body <lb/>from another place &amp; it was likely <lb/>that  as I did not appear to know <lb/>the shore I might have put in to the <lb/>harbour ignorant of the distance <lb/>of the town of —— from the place where <lb/>I had deposited the 
      corpse.</p><p> <lb/>&gt;M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Kirwin on hearing this
      evidence <lb/>desired that I should be taken into the <lb/>room where the body lay for interment <lb/>that it might be observed what effect <lb/>the sight of it would produce upon me. <lb/>This idea was probably suggested by <lb/>the extreme agitation I had exhibited <lb/> when the mode of the murder had <lb/>been  described. I was according <lb/>ly conducted by the Magistrate &amp; several <lb/>other persons to the Inn. I could not <lb/>help being struck by the strange coin <lb/>cidences that had taken place during <lb/>this eventful night but knowing that <lb/>I had been  conversing with several <lb/>persons in the island I had inhabited <lb/>about the time that the body <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>had been found</p></ab>
