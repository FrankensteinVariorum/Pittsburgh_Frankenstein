The spire <lb/>of Evian shone under the woods that <lb/>surrounded it &amp; the range of mountain <lb/>above mountain <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>by which <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>it was overhung .</p><p> <lb/>The wind which had hitherto carried <lb/>us along with amazing rapidity sunk <lb/>at sunset to a gentle breeze â€“ the light <lb/>air just ruffled the water &amp; caused a <lb/>pleasant motion among the trees. As we <lb/>approached the shore it wafted the <lb/>most delightful scent of flowers &amp; hay. <lb/>The  sun sunk beneath the horizon <lb/>as we landed and as I touched the shore <lb/>I felt those cares and fears revive <lb/>which soon were to clasp me &amp;
        cling to me <lb/>forever.</p></ab>
