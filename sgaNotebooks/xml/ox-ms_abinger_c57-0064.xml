The child still struggled <lb/>&amp; loaded me with epithets which carried <lb/>despair to my heart – I grasped his throat <lb/>to silence him &amp; in a moment he lay <lb/>dead at my feet.</p><p> <lb/>I gazed on my victim and my heart <lb/>swelled with exultation and hellish <lb/>triumph —  clapping my hands  I exclaimed <lb/>I too can make desolate. – My enemy is not impreg <lb/>nable; this death will carry despair to <lb/>him &amp; a thousand thousand others <metamark>^</metamark>miseries <lb/> shall torment &amp; destroy him. <lb/>As I fixed my eyes on the child I saw <lb/> <lb/>something glittering on his breast – I took
      it <lb/>I was the portrait of a most lovely woman. <lb/>In spite of my malignity  it <lb/>softened and attracted me. for a few <lb/>moments I gazed with delight on her <lb/>dark deep eyes &amp; lovely lips but <lb/>presently my rage returned: I remembered <lb/>that I was for ever deprived of the <lb/>delights such  beautiful
      creatures <lb/>could bestow – and that  she whose <lb/>resemblance I contemplated  would, <lb/> in regarding me have, changed <lb/>that air of divine benignity to one of <lb/>horror &amp; detestation.</p><p> <lb/>Can you wonder that such <lb/>thoughts transported me with rage? <lb/>I only wonder that at that moment <lb/>instead of venting my sensations in <lb/>useless exclamations &amp; agony I did not <lb/>rush among mankind and perish <lb/>in the attempt to destroy them.</p></ab>
