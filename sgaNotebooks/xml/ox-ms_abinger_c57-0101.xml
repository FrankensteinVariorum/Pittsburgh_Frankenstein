      ungazed at <lb/>and unmolested, hardly thanked for the <lb/>pittance of food and clothes which I gave <lb/>so much does suffering blunt even <lb/>the coarsest sensations of men.</p><p> <lb/></p><p> <lb/>In this retreat I devoted the mor <lb/>ning to labour, but in the evening, <lb/>when the weather permitted I walked <lb/>on the stony beach of the sea to listen <lb/>to the waves as they roared &amp; dashed at <lb/>my feet; It was a monotonous yet <lb/>ever changing scene. I thought of Swit <lb/>zerland; It was far different from <lb/>this desolate &amp; appalling landscape –Its <lb/>hills are covered with vines &amp; its <lb/>cottages are scattered thickly in the <lb/>plains— Its fair lakes reflect a <lb/>blue &amp; gentle sky &amp; when troubled <lb/>by the winds it is but the play of <lb/>a lively infant when compared <lb/>to the roarings of the giant ocean.</p><p> <lb/>Inthis  manner I <lb/>distributed my occupations when I first <lb/>arrived; but as I proceeded in my work it <lb/>became every day more horrible &amp; irksome <lb/>to me. Sometimes I could  not prevail <lb/>on myself to enter my <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>laboratory for several <lb/>days and at other times I toiled day &amp; <lb/>night in order to complete it. It was indeed <lb/>a  filthy work in which I was
      en- <lb/>gaged. <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>During my first experiment a kind of <lb/>enthusiastic frenzy <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>had blinded me to the <lb/>horror of my employment; my mind was <lb/>intently fixed on the sequel of my labour</p></ab>
