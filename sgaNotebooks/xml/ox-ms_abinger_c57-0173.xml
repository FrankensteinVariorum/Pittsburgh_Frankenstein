The brave fellows whom I persua <lb/>ded to be my companions look at me for aid <lb/>but I have none <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>to bestow. There is somthing terribly appall <lb/>ing in our situation Yet my courage &amp; hopes do <lb/>not desert me — We may survive &amp; if we do not – <lb/>I will repeat the lessons of my Seneca &amp; die with a <lb/>good heart.</p><p> <lb/>Yet what, Mar<damage type="inkblot">gar</damage>et, will
      be your state – You <lb/>will not hear of my destruction and you will <lb/>anxiously await my return – Years will pass <lb/>and you will have visitings of despair &amp; <lb/>yet be cheered by hope. Oh my beloved sister <lb/>the  sicknening failings of your heart <lb/>felt expectations  are in prospect <lb/>more terrible to me than my own death –But <lb/>you have a husband and lovely children— <lb/>you may be happy — Heaven bless you &amp; <lb/>make you so.</p><p> <lb/>My  unfortunate guest regards <lb/>me with the tenderest compassion – He <lb/> endeavours to fill me with hope – And <lb/>talks as if life were a thing which he loved <lb/>He reminds me how often the same acci <lb/>dents have happened to other navigators, <lb/>who have attempted the same sea. In <lb/>spite of myself he fills me with cheerful <lb/>auguries. Even the sailors feel the benefit <lb/>of his eloquence – when he speaks they <lb/>no longer despair – he rouzes their ener <lb/>gies &amp; they believe  these vast mountains <lb/>of ice are mole hills which will va <lb/>nish before the resolutions of man. <lb/> this is but transitory and each <lb/>days expectation delayed, fills them fear &amp; <lb/>I almost dread the mutiny of despair</p></ab>
