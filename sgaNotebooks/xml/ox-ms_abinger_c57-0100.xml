With this resolution I traversed <lb/>the northern highlands and fixed on one of the <lb/>Orkney Islands for the scene of my labours. <lb/> It was a place fitted for such <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>a work; <lb/>being hardly more than a rock whose high <lb/>sides were continually beaten upon by the <lb/>waves– The soil was barren hardly affording <lb/>pasture for a few miserable cows &amp; oat <lb/>meal for its  inhabitants which consis <lb/>ted of five persons, Whose gaunt &amp;
      scraggy <lb/>limbs gave tokens of their sorry fare.  <lb/> Vegetables &amp; bread, when they indulged <lb/>in such luxuries, &amp; even fresh water was <lb/>to be procured from the main land which <lb/>was about five miles distant. On the <lb/>whole island there were but three mise <lb/>rable huts &amp; one of these was vacant <lb/>when I arrived. This I hired– It contained <lb/>but two rooms &amp;  these exhibited all <lb/>the squalidness of the most miserable <lb/>penury— The thatch had fallen in – the <lb/>walls were unplastered &amp; the door was off
      its <lb/>hinges. I ordered it to be repaired,  bought <lb/>some furniture &amp; took possession – an <lb/>incident which would have <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>doubtless occasioned <lb/>some surprise had not all the  senses <lb/>of the cottagers been benumbed by want</p></ab>
