You <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>can blast my <lb/>other passions but revenge remains; revenge <lb/>dearer than light or food. I may die but <lb/>first you my tyrant &amp; tormentor shall <lb/>curse the sun that gazes on your misery. <lb/>Beware, for I am fearless &amp; therefore <lb/>powerful. I will watch with the wiliness <lb/>of a  snake that I may sting with <lb/>its venom. Man, you shall repent <lb/>of the injuries you inflict.</p><p> <lb/>Devil, I cried, Cease, &amp; do not <lb/>poison the air with those sounds <lb/>of malice. I have declared my resolution <lb/>to you and I am no coward to bend <lb/>beneath words â€“ Leave me, I am inexo <lb/>rable.</p><p> <lb/>It is well, said he, I go; but remem <lb/>ber!
