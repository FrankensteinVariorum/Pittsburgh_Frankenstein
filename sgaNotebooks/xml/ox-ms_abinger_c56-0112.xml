      My <lb/>abhorrence of this fiend cannot be <lb/>conceived â€“ When I thought of him I <lb/>gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflam <lb/>ed and I ardently wished to extinguish <lb/>that life which I had so thoughtlessly <lb/>bestowed. When I  reflected on his <lb/>crimes and malice, my hatred and <lb/>revenge burst all bounds of moderation <lb/> <lb/> I would have made a pilgrimage <lb/>to the highestpeak of the Andes could I when
      there <lb/>have precipitated him to their base; I <lb/>wished but to see him again that <lb/>I might wreak the utmost extent of <lb/>anger on his head and avenge the <lb/>deaths of William and Justine.</p><p> <lb/>Our house was  the
      house <lb/>of mourning, my father's health was deeply <lb/>shaken by the horror of the recent <lb/>events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding <lb/>she no longer took delight in her <lb/>ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed <lb/>to her sacriledge towards the dead; eter <lb/><metamark>=</metamark>nal <lb/>woe and tears she then thought was the <lb/>just tribute she should pay to innocence <lb/>so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer <lb/>that happy creature </p></ab>
