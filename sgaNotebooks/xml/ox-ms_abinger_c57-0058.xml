You had endowed me with percep <lb/>tions and passions and then cast me <lb/>abroard for the scorn &amp; horror of man <lb/>kind —  But on you only had I any <lb/>claim &amp; from you I determined to seek that <lb/>justice  which I  vainly
      attempted <lb/>to gain from  <lb/>any other being <lb/>that wore the human <lb/>form. .</p><p> <lb/>My travels were long and  the <lb/> sufferings
      I endured intense –It was <lb/>late in autumn when I quitted the <lb/>district where I had so long resided –  <lb/> I tra <lb/>velled only at night, fearful of meeting <lb/>the visage of a human being.—Nature <lb/>decayed around me and the sun became <lb/> heatless,—rain &amp;
        snow poured around me and I <lb/>found no shelter — Oh Earth how often <lb/>did I imprecate curses on the cause of <lb/>my being— The mildness of  my nature <lb/>had fled &amp; all within me was turned to gall <lb/>&amp; bitterness –  <lb/> the nearer I approached
      to your habi <lb/>tation the more deeply did I feel the spirit <lb/>of revenge become kind led in my heart—</p></ab>
