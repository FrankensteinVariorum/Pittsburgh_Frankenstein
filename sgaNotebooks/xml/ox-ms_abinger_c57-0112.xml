The sky had become clouded but the <lb/>air was pure although  chilled by the <lb/>North-East breeze that was rising. But <lb/>it refreshed &amp; filled me with such agreable <lb/>sensations that I resolved to prolong <lb/>my stay on the water &amp; fixing the rudder <lb/><metamark function="insert">^</metamark> <lb/>in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. <lb/>Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure <lb/>&amp; I heard only the sound of the boat as it <lb/>keel cut through the waves–The sound <lb/>lulled me–&amp; in a short time I slept  <lb/>soundly</p><p> <lb/>I do not know how long I remained in <lb/>this situation but when I awoke I found <lb/>that the sun had already mounted considerably– <lb/>The wind was high and the waves 
      continually <lb/>threatened the safety of my little 
      skiff— <lb/>I  found that the wind was
      north- <lb/>east and must have driven me far <lb/>from the coast from which I had embarked. <lb/>I endeavoured to <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>change my course but <lb/>quickly found that if I again <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>made the attempt <lb/>the boat would be instantly filled with <lb/>water. Thus situated my only resource was <lb/>to drive before the wind –  I
      confess <lb/>that I felt a few sensations of terror –I had <lb/>no compass with me and was so little <lb/>acquainted with the geography of this part <lb/>of the world that the sun was of little be <lb/>nefit to me –I might be  driven
      into <lb/>the wide Atlantic &amp; feel all the tortures <lb/>of starvation or be swallowed up in <lb/>immeasurable waters that roared &amp;</p></ab>
