      day <lb/> <lb/>on which <lb/>I should <lb/>expect you – but that would be <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>a cruel <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>kindness <lb/>and I dare not do it. What would <metamark function="insert">^</metamark>be your <lb/>surprise , my son, when
      your ex <lb/>pected a happy and gay welcome to  <lb/>beheld on the contrary tears and wretched <lb/>ness. And how, Victor, can I relate our <lb/>misfortune? absence cannot have rendered <lb/>you callous to our joys and griefs and how <lb/>can I inflict pain on an absent child.? <lb/>I wish to prepare you for the woeful <lb/>news but I know it is impossible; even <lb/>now your eye skims over the page to <lb/>seek the words which are to convey to <lb/>you the horrible tidings.</p><p> <lb/>William is dead! That sweet child <lb/>whose smiles delighted &amp; warmed me <lb/>who was so gentle yet so gay, Victor, he <lb/>is Murdered!</p><p> <lb/>I will not attempt to 
      console you <lb/>but will simply relate the circumstances <lb/>of the transaction.</p></ab>
