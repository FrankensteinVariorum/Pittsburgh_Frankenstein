Thomas Copy: ebb checking 2018-01-04
This is not a transcript. I am simply checking Rieger against the original.
NOTES: They don't know where the microfilm is. :-( As soon as they find it (it's been misplaced) we can purchase a copy. 

(Oh my! her handwriting is tiny and precise in this little octavo volume!) NOTE: This is three volumes in one.
