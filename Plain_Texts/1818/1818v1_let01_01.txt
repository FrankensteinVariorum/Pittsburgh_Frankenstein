MODERN PROMETHEUS. 
LETTER I 
To Mrs. SAVILLE, England. 
St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17--. 
YOU will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare, and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.
