text: As Victor's cousin, Elizabeth also will play other family roles as "sister," substitute "mother," and finally "wife." In 1831 Mary Shelley changes Elizabeth role so that she is a foundling, unrelated to Victor by blood. Some modern critics believe this 1831 change avoids the possibilty of incest in the 1818 novel, and makes the later novel more conservative in implication. For the first argument of this kind, see Ellen Moers, "Female Gothic: The Monster's Mother," *New York Review of Books*, March 21 and April 4, 1974

text: By 1818 physiology had become a controversial branch of medicine at the center of the dispute between vitalism, the idea that a divine spark energized animal life, and materialism, the argument that chemical processes alone give rise to life. Mary Shelley was well aware of the dispute since the Shelleys' family doctor, William Lawrence, was vigorously taking up the materialist argument in works like *An Introduction to Comparative Anatomy and Physiology** (1816). For a full view of this controversy as it relates to the novel, see Marilyn Butler, "*Frankenstein* and Radical Science" [1993] reprinted in J.

Mary Shelley indirectly refers the reader to the vastly popular London lectures on the sciences to which audiences had been flocking since Humphry Davy's inaugural lectures in 1802. Anne Mellor has persuasively argued that Davy was a partial model for the character of Victor in this novel. But English scientific lectures were also widely printed through the eighteenth century before Davy's time. For a good example of published lectures Victor might have read in the later eighteenth century, see J. T. Desaguliers, *A Course of Experimental Philosophy,* (London, 1734-44).

Erasmus Darwin had made "not of impossible occurrence" that one presently visible species could mutate into another. Victor clearly contemplates this possibility--as an alarming pone--when he speculates in chapter XX that the Creature's demand that he create a "mate" could result in a new evolutionary development, "a race of devils."

Clerval could not have been a Romantic poet, though his sensibilities might have made him one, had he not been killed by the Creature.
