### paradise, religion, Milton, imagination, Hell, poetry

Walton's imagined "paradise" of his own making suggests the power of imagination, yet also the possibility of creating a Hell of one's own as well (Victor).

### natural philosophy

A key instrument for scientific experiment on gases, the first fully successful air-pump was created for Robert Boyle's experiments at the Royal Society in 1658. Victor's enthusiasm for a modern scientific instrument counterbalances his attraction to magic and pre-modern philosophy. For the wider significance of this invention, see Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, *Leviathan and the Air Pump* (1985).

## jonklancher, 10/6/2017 5:33:41 PM

### family, incest

As Victor's cousin, Elizabeth also will play other family roles as "sister," substitute "mother," and finally "wife." In 1831 Mary Shelley changes Elizabeth role so that she is a foundling, unrelated to Victor by blood. Some modern critics believe this 1831 change avoids the possibilty of incest in the 1818 novel, and makes the later novel more conservative in implication. For the first argument of this kind, see Ellen Moers, "Female Gothic: The Monster's Mother," *New York Review of Books*, March 21 and April 4, 1974

### Switzerland, political philosophy, geography

Born in Geneva Switzerland, Victor is a potential hero insofar as he embodies the "republican" virtue's of Europe's only country, much admired by the Shelleys, which did not have a hereditary monarchy. By making Geneva so central to the novel's cultural geography, Mary Shelley also designates the relation between Victor's ambition and Jean Jacques Rousseau's world-making ambition in *Discourse on Inequality* among other works.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:47:05 PM

### geography, england

Victor's decision to tour the English countryside, rather than take the fastest road to Edinburgh, affords his party the chance to compare English geography to Europe's and they do so it considerable detail, beginning with this comparsion of the country around Matlock to Switzerland. Matlock was south of the industrial cities of Manchester and Leeds, but it is on the way to the Lake District in Victor's northern tour.


## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:40:26 PM

No university in Europe could have been more the opposite of the University of Ingolstadt (where Victor learned his science) than Oxford University, seat of theological learning and a holdout against any form of Enlightenment sciences. Victor also initially nostalgic for the days of Charles I when the absolute monarch was beleaguered in the early years of the English Revolution (1642-1659). He later praises the republican opponent of Charles I, John Hampden. What version of England's poltical past she means to commemorate in this chapter remains an interesting question.

### Goethe, Sorrows of Werther

The Creature clearly identifies himself with the hero of Goethe's novel *The Sorrows of Werther* but unlike many of its European readers, Werther is not a glamorous figure but an emblem of the Creature's own isolation and despair. On the relation of these novels, see also

### Percy Shelley, poetry

This stanza from Percy Shelley's poem "Mutability" (1816)  may have helped convince readers of 1818 that the novel's author was indeed Percy rather than Mary, since it is not attributed to its author. But it also, of course, is far outside the novel's fictional eighteenth century setting. For more on the standing of poetry in the novel, see 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:02:25 PM

### family, empire

Victor's realization that his own pursuit of knowledge has weakened or damaged his "domestic affections" begins Shelley's extended argument on this question. But this passage on empire building as the greatest historical antagonist to domestic tranquillity suggests it is the ambition to dominate rather than "science" as such that destroys domestic life.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:01:40 PM

By 1818 physiology had become a controversial branch of medicine at the center of the dispute between vitalism, the idea that a divine spark energized animal life, and materialism, the argument that chemical processes alone give rise to life. Mary Shelley was well aware of the dispute since the Shelleys' family doctor, William Lawrence, was vigorously taking up the materialist argument in works like *An Introduction to Comparative Anatomy and Physiology** (1816). For a full view of this controversy as it relates to the novel, see Marilyn Butler, "*Frankenstein* and Radical Science" [1993] reprinted in J. Paul Hunter, *Frankenstein,* Norton Critical Edition, second ed. (New York: Norton, 2012) 404-416.

### Henry Clerval, poetry

Victor distinguishes Henry Clerval from those, like own his father, who dissociatee commercial life from polite learning. Henry. is a master of languages and especially values poetry, a passion that makes him both equal to Victor's passion for natural philosophy and opposed to it. For more on the exceptional role of Clerval, see 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:54:02 PM

### family

The death of Victor's mother, caused by her catching Elizabeth's scarlet fever, would lead in Victor's mind to a morbid association between the two women. It appears more vividly in Victor's nightmare in chapter XX, associated there with his first horror at beholding his creature. On the maternal and even incestuous dimensions of this passage, see also

### education, enlightenment, geography

Founded in 1472 in Bavaria, about 400 miles northeast of Geneva, this university became a leading center of scientific learning in the eighteenth century; the emergence of the Illuminati there in 1776 also identified it with the radical enlightenment. northeast of Geneva.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:46:05 PM

### lectures, natural philosophy, Humphry Davy

Far more than printed books, attendance at lectures on natural philosophy instructed thousands of eighteenth-century students of the sciences. Mary Shelley indirectly refers the reader to the vastly popular London lectures on the sciences to which audiences had been flocking since Humphry Davy's inaugural lectures in 1802. Anne Mellor has persuasively argued that Davy was a partial model for the character of Victor in this novel. But English scientific lectures were also widely printed through the eighteenth century before Davy's time. For a good example of published lectures Victor might have read in the later eighteenth century, see J. T. Desaguliers, *A Course of Experimental Philosophy,* (London, 1734-44).

### science

Not called "science" until the nineteenth century, "natural philosophy" was science in the tradition of England's Royal Society, with its emphasis on Baconian induction, careful experiment, and refusal of any older science that could not be proven and demonstrated in a laboratory. On works of "natural philosophy" that Victor might have read, see also XXX

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:38:40 PM

### romance, imagination

Like Robert Walton's love for poetry, Henry Clerval's love for books of chivalry and romance makes him sociable and open to domestic affections, unlike Victor. Yet Victor will later regret that he did not have Henry's or Victor's orientation to languages and poetry at the most important moments.

Victor also yearns for a friend, having lost this former friend of "noble" stature.  On friendship in the novel, see also

### creature

The first sighting of the Creature in the Arctic, which shortly precedes the appearance of Victor. His "gigantic stature" will later be revealed as a height of about eight feet tall. This seemingly minor dimension of the Creature's power can be appreciated when we think about how few giants or outsized human figures appear in modern realism since the mid-18th century.  On this point, see Mark McGurl, GIANTS essay 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:26:20 PM

### Samuel Taylor Coleridge, poetry

A reference to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," in which the Mariner inexplicably slays an albatross. This allusion may imply that Walton will play the role of Coleridge's Wedding Guest instead: he will listen to Victor's long, obsessive story. Since the poem was not published until September, 1798, this reference also places the "17--" of the action as the summer of 1799. For the novel's many references to this poem, see XXX

### class

Robert's shipmaster is working class ("unsoftened by cultivation") but also unusually kind, generous, and mild-tempered. At other times in the novel Mary Shelley will imply fear and distrust of the English working class. On this issue, see Warren Montage. xxx

### sympathy, friendship

Both Robert and Victor Frankenstein yearn for a male friend; only Robert expresses this desire as a wish for "sympathy," the great human virtue of fellow feeling celebrated in sentimental novels and moral philosophy. 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:23:53 PM

### https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818.html, poetry, imagination

Walton's wish to be a poet, like Henry Clerval's taste for tales of romance, attest to their imaginativeness and greater capacity for sympathy than Victor, who has no literary interests, will show.  Victor also suggests that had his fate not turned out differently, he might have been a Henry Clerval. SEE chapter xx.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:22:48 PM

### north pole, arctic, religion

Robert imagines the cold North Pole as a sunny garden, suggesting a kind of Paradise as the destination toward which his scientific quest is moving. This is one of many affinities to Victor, whose fall into the profane knowledge of modern science, also links him to Adam's expulsion from the Garden of Eden.

Still a genre not recognized as worthy of being called literature, even in the 1818 edition, thie novel gains some  stature from this association with Milton, Shakespeare, and Greek epic and poetry.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:16:41 PM

### Erasmus Darwin, science, poetry

Erasmus Darwin, the evolutionist and poet hailing from Birmingham England, is clearly on Percy Shelley's mind when he introduces Mary's text in the 1818 edition. Critics of the novel have not often followed this lead in thinking about it as an early work in the British evolutionary imagination. Erasmus Darwin had made "not of impossible occurrence" that one presently visible species could mutate into another. Victor clearly contemplates this possibility--as an alarming pone--when he speculates in chapter XX that the Creature's demand that he create a "mate" could result in a new evolutionary development, "a race of devils."

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 7:11:55 PM

Given how often Wordsworth and Coleridge are quoted in the novel, it seems inevitable that Victor would tour the Lake Country in northern England, the scene of "Tintern Abbey" and many of the *Lyrical Ballads*, 

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 7:10:24 PM

The Creature cites Satan's confession in Milton's *Paradise Lost*: "all Good to me is lost; / Evil be thou my Good" (4: 109-110). 

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:49:01 PM

### Malthus, population

Victor's frightening imagination of a "race of devils" that would be "propagated upon the earth" may owe something to fears of vast population increase in the wake of debates over Thomas Malthus's predictions in *An Essay on the Principle of Population* (1798), which were being fiercely debated (by Godwin and William Hazlitt among others) around the time of the novel's composition. See also Clara Tuite, "Frankenstein's Monster and Malthus's 'Jaundiced Eye': Population, Body Politics, and the Monstrous Sublime." *Eighteenth Century Life,* 22.1 (1998)

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:34:32 PM

Victor's admiration for John Hampden (1595-1643)--a leading English dissident opposing Charles I in the early years of the English Revolution--sits uneasily with his earlier nostalgia for the days of Charles I. Where the Creature had shown a consistent and clear sympathy with the radical Enlightenment, Victor seems as confused about the reactionary and progressive elements of the English past as he had about the modern and premodern versions of "natural philosophy" in the history of science. See also Iain Crawford, "Wading Through Slaughter: John Hampden, Thomas Gray, and Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*," *Studies in the Novel,* 20.3 (1988): 249-61.

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:34:04 PM

This is what Wordsworth says of his sister Dorothy in the final section of "Tintern Abbey"--she is an image of his former self, the one enraptured by the cataracts of 1793, his first visit to the Wye Valley, not the matured mind speaking in the poem of 1798. But now it is Victor who sees in Henry Clerval his own "former" and potential self--inquisitive and open to possibility, rather than the blasted tragic self Victor now sees himself as having become. 

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:34:03 PM

Victor could (possibly) have read "Tintern Abbey"(published in September 1798) within the novel's time frame. But the lines quoted here suggest Clerval is identified, not with the poet of 1798 who wrote this poem, but with the earlier moment in Wordsworth's genealogy when his senses were wholly absorbed in the sights and sounds of "nature"--and not yet with the "philosophic mind" that Wordsworth's poem makes the final stage of coming to poetiic powers. Clerval could not have been a Romantic poet, though his sensibilities might have made him one, had he not been killed by the Creature.

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 5:45:35 PM

### Leigh Hunt, poetry, Romanticism

Victor quotes Leigh Hunt's poem "The Story of Rimini," published in 1816--a poem Victor could not, of course, have known in the novel's fictional time frame that ends in summer 1799. Like the passage from Percy Shelley's "Mutability," this line from Hunt's poem belongs to the novel's extra-diagetic address to readers of 1818 rather than to canons of novelistic realism. Clerval is once again made an avatar of the Romantic poet that by 1818 had become solidly esconced in the British cultural imaginary.





## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 8:19:14 PM

### novel

This is a reflexive moment in the novel when the Creature seems to have read something very much like the story Victor has told to Robert Walton in Volume 1--an account of what made him fabricate the Creature and its horrifying aftermath. 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 8:14:36 PM

Mary Shelley seems to confuse "Turk" with "Arab" here, and more generally her picture of Safie's father as both suffering Christian religious prejudices (against Muslims) and yet himself acting as a wily, untrustworthy figure seems to reflect "commonplaces of eighteenth-century liberalism," as Gayatri Spivak observes in *A Critique of Postcolonial Reason* (1999). 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:55:14 PM

### knowledge, empire, inequality

The Creature's story emphasizes the complex question of knowledge--how "strange" and contradictory it is to have, how "sorrow only increased with knowledge"--in ways that suggest it is drastically reductive to see in this novel only a warning against science.

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:52:53 PM

### Volney, radical Enlightenment, empire

Of the books the Creature learns in the forest, Volney's *The Ruins of Empires* was most closely associated with Europe's radical Enlightenment. While the Creature learns a powerful critique of power, imperialism, and exploitation from hearing Volney read aloud, he also absorbs some of the Enlightenment's own prejudices and ethnic stereotypes ("slothful Asiatics"). But the overall effect on the Creature is to give him a sense of the structural and not merely personal framework for understanding virtue and suffering.

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:40:45 PM

### sympathy, family

The eighteenth century British discourse of "sympathy" is especially vivid in the Creature's instinctive opening onto the emotions of others, echoing. as James Chandler shows, Adam Smith's arguments in *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759). 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:13:20 PM

### famly, domestic affections

The Creature first learns these figures by their family names of brother, sister, father, daughter as much as by their proper names, a sign that he is sensitive to "domestic affections"

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:12:03 PM

### John Milton, Paradise Lost, poetry

At this moment the Creature appears more strongly associated with Adam than with Satan, apparently born into a "paradise."

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:12:01 PM

### John Locke, empirical epistemology, education

The Creature's awakening to consciousness follows John Locke's account of how the mind slowly learns to distjnguish the various senses before it can apprehend the world.


## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:03:59 PM

### John Milton, poetry

This allusion to Milton's *Paradise Lost* puzzles some readers because the epigram of Volume II has previously quoted Adam's entreaty to God. Is the Creature more like Adam or more like the fallen angel Satan?

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 6:40:00 PM

### language

Clerval's love of languages, as opposed to the "minutiae of science," will later resonate with the Creature's perception that "language is a Godlike science." 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 6:39:51 PM

### family, domestic affections

Victor's intensely morbid association of Elizabeth with his dead mother, prefigured by his mother's death from scarlet fever in chapter XX, associates his act of creating the Creature (whom he has just witnessed for the first time) with this disturbing disruption of the "domestic affections." 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 6:39:45 PM

### Samuel, poetry

In this passage from Part VI of "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," the Mariner faces the apparition of the dead sailors -- as if in a "charnel-dungeon"--standing to rebuke him for their deaths.

### orientalism

Both Cerval's mastery of foreign languages and his commercial activity in the "orient" (or Middle East) become a foil for the "natural philosophy" associated with Germany and northern Europe in the novel. 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 5:32:44 PM

### electricity, natural philosophy

Like the air-pump, recent experiments with electricity also fascinate Victor even while he reaches for a non-modern "system" that would be antithetical to empirical scientific reason.

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535) was author of *De Occulta Philosophia**, known to practice magic, and considered nonsensical by modern natural philosophy.

### St. Petersburgh, arctic, religion

One of the northernmost cities in Russia, St. Petersburgh, along with the city Archangel mentioned below, suggest a journey with theological overtones as Robert Walton moves closer on his expedition to discovering the principle of creation, magnetism, and thus symbolically the seat of God.

William Godwin was Mary Godwin's father, the leading radical political philosopher of the Romantic period.

### sympathy, moral philosophy

Throughout the novel Shelley appeals to moral philosophy's principle of sympathy, most fully argued in 
Adam Smith's *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759); Victor's failure to extend sympathy to his creature, by every reader's account, contributes to the ruin of both.

## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 4:18:06 PM

### poetry, Coleridge

This reference to Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," which becomes more explicit in the 1831 text, dates Walton's letters at summer 1799, less than a year after the poem's first publication in Lyrical Ballads (November 1798). 

## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 4:02:22 PM

### science

Magnetism, according to contemporary theories of electricity, was potentially the source of all life. Mary Shelley draws especially on the physiologist William Lawrence for this conjecture. Lawrence famously debated John Abernathy's vitalist account of a divine spark animating life by counterposing a materialist electrochemical thesis of life's origins.


## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 4:02:06 PM

### religion

These towns in Russia also indicate Walton's progression from the place of saints to the place of archangels on the "road" toward the site of God's ultimate creative powers at the pole, the site of magnetic power.

The North Pole designates the physical place of magnetism. "North Sea" is likely synonym for Arctic Ocean.
