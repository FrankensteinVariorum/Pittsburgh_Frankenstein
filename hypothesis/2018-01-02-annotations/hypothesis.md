### Volney, radical Enlightenment, empire

Of the books the Creature learns in the forest, Volney's *The Ruins of Empires* was most closely associated with Europe's radical Enlightenment. While the Creature learns a powerful critique of power, imperialism, and exploitation from hearing Volney read aloud, he also absorbs some of the Enlightenment's own prejudices and ethnic stereotypes ("slothful Asiatics"). But the overall effect on the Creature is to give him a sense of the structural and not merely personal framework for understanding virtue and suffering.  See also Ian Balfour, "Allegories of Origins: Frankenstein after the Enlightenment," *SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500-1900* 56.4 (2016): 777-98.

### law, legal system, lawyers, professions

(Deleted in 1831). Percy Shelley had suffered negative rulings by the English court system and Mary seems to share his moral judgment on the legal profession. This skepticism will soon be reinforced in the novel by the court's harsh treatment of Justine Moritz. 

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 5:59:33 PM

### family, domestic affections, incest, mother, daughter, sister

Victor's intensely morbid association of Elizabeth with his dead mother, prefigured by his mother's death from scarlet fever in Chapter 1 of Book 1, associates his act of creating the Creature (whom he has just witnessed for the first time) with this disturbing disruption of the "domestic affections." 

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 5:56:15 PM

### Samuel, poetry, monster, paranoia

In this passage from Part VI of "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," the Mariner faces the apparition of the dead sailors -- as if in a "charnel-dungeon"--standing to rebuke him for their deaths. 

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 5:51:04 PM

### Samuel Taylor Coleridge, poetry, "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", Lyrical Ballads, Romanticism, murder, guilt

A reference to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," in which the Mariner inexplicably slays an albatross. This allusion may imply that Walton will play the role of Coleridge's Wedding Guest instead: he will listen to Victor's long, obsessive story. Since the poem was not published until September, 1798, this reference also places the "17--" of the action as the summer of 1799. On the poem's role in the novel, see Beth Lau, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Frankenstein," in Nicholas Roe, ed., *Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Sciences of Life* (Oxford University Press, 2001): 207-23.

### voyages, Northwest Passage, geography

Both commercial and scientific voyages have been searching for a Northwest passage or open seaway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. For the Arctic context of the novel, see Adriana Craciun, "Writing the Disaster: Franklin and *Frankenstein*," *Nineteenth-Century Literature,* 65.4 (2011): 433-80.

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 5:04:44 PM

### magnetism, north pole

Robert's expedition hopes to reach the magnetic North Pole. Contemporary scientific debates suggested magnetism as the most powerful natural force responsible for life. For a full account of magnetism and electricity in the novel and its offspring, see Iwan Rhys Morus, *Frankenstein's Children: Electricity, Exhibition, and Experiment in Early Ninteenth-Century London* (Princeton University Press, 1998).

### St. Petersburgh, arctic, religion, geography, Russia

One of the northernmost cities in Russia, St. Petersburgh, along with the city Archangel mentioned below, suggest a journey with theological overtones as Robert Walton moves ever closer on his expedition to his aim of discovering the principle of life, magnetism, and thus symbolically the seat of God.

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 4:35:18 PM

### ghost stories, scene of creation, gothic

These German ghost stories were translated into French for the book Mary, Percy, and Byron read during the summer; its French title was *Fantasmagoria; ou Recueil d'Histoires, d'Apparitions, de Spectres, Revenans, Fantomes, etc.*, translated by Jean-Baptiste Benoit Eyries in 1812. 

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 4:23:34 PM

### climate, Geneva Summer, Tambora, geography

In 1816 the eruption of the volcano Mount Tambora (Indonesia) created extreme weather around the world in what came to be called "the year without a summer." See Gillen D'Arcy Wood, *Tambora: The Eruption that Changed the World,* (Princeton University Press, 2015). Food shortages and cold affected millions of Europeans.

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 4:09:13 PM

### Shakespeare, romance (genre), The Tempest

Despite the comparison of these  Shakespeare plays to Greek tragic poetry, *The Tempest* and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" are romances, not tragedies. While Victor's fate and the Creature's condition can be called tragic, the genre of romance plays a powerful leading role in the novel.

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 4:06:15 PM

Despite the comparison of these  Shakespeare plays to Greek tragic poetry, *The Tempest* and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" are romances, not tragedies. While Victor's fate and the Creature's condition can be called tragic, the genre of romance plays a powerful leading role in the novel.

## jonklancher, 12/30/2017 4:04:04 PM

### authorship

Audiences and reviewers first took the novel to be written by Percy Shelley. According to Mary Shelley in her 1831 edition of the novel, Percy wrote the entirety of this 1818 Preface, which would reappear in all future editions.

## jonklancher, 12/17/2017 9:17:21 PM

### chemistry, Humphry Davy, alchemy

The special role of chemistry in Victor's apprenticeship to medicine links premodern sciences like alchemy to modern empirical science. Humphry Davy was the contemporary chemist who argued the chemistry was the key to all other sciences and useful arts of the time. 

## jonklancher, 12/17/2017 9:14:17 PM

### mother, family, domestic affections

With Victor's mother's death, her wish for Elizabeth begins a series of symbolic family roles she will occupy: mother to the children, "sister" to Victor, and eventually "wife" to Victor.

## jonklancher, 12/17/2017 9:12:00 PM

### science, natural philosophy, fate

Not called "science" until the mid-nineteenth century, "natural philosophy" was science in the tradition of England's Royal Society, with its emphasis on Baconian induction, careful experiment, and refusal of any older science that could not be proven and demonstrated in a laboratory. On works of "natural philosophy" that Victor might have read, see also XXX

## jonklancher, 12/17/2017 9:10:02 PM

### family, incest, child, mother

As Victor's cousin, Elizabeth also will play other family roles as "sister," substitute "mother," and finally "wife." In 1831 Mary Shelley changes Elizabeth role so that she is a foundling, unrelated to Victor by blood. Some modern critics believe this 1831 change avoids the possibilty of incest in the 1818 novel, and makes the later novel more conservative in implication. For the first argument of this kind, see Ellen Moers, "Female Gothic: The Monster's Mother," *New York Review of Books*, March 21 and April 4, 1974

## jonklancher, 12/17/2017 9:05:58 PM

### sympathy, friendship, brother

Both Robert and Victor Frankenstein yearn for a male friend; only Robert expresses this desire as a wish for "sympathy," the great human virtue of fellow feeling celebrated in sentimental novels and moral philosophy. 

## jonklancher, 12/17/2017 8:59:32 PM

### novel, literature

Even by 1818, the novel was still a genre not recognized as worthy of being called literature. This may be partly why Shelley suggests novel should bear comparison with, and aspire to the stature of, poetry and drama;  Miltonic, Shakespearean, and Greek.

## jonklancher, 12/17/2017 8:52:20 PM

### John Milton, poetry, religion, creator, Adam

By citing Adam's question to God in John Milton's *Paradise Lost,* Mary Shelley makes Milton's epic the most important intertext of Frankenstein. It will be the most important book the Creatures hears read aloud in Book II. It provokes the Creature to think of himself as either Adam or Satan. (cited here is Book x, chapter x, lines xxx)

### romance, imagination

Like Robert Walton's love for poetry, Henry Clerval's love for books of chivalry and romance makes him sociable and open to domestic affections, unlike Victor. Yet Victor will later regret that he did not have Henry's or Victor's orientation to languages and poetry at the most important moments.

## jonklancher, 12/15/2017 9:39:11 PM

### family, domestic affections

Like Elizabeth, Henry is made part of the family and shares the "domestic affections" that we later learn are what Victor's quest for knowledge threatens.

### science, magic, Cornelius Agrippa, alchemy

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535) was author of *De Occulta Philosophia**, known to practice magic, and considered nonsensical by modern natural philosophy.

### Henry Clerval, poetry

Victor distinguishes Henry Clerval from those, like own his father, who dissociatee commercial life from polite learning. Henry. is a master of languages and especially values poetry, a passion that makes him both equal to Victor's passion for natural philosophy and opposed to it. For more on the exceptional role of Clerval, see XX

## jonklancher, 12/15/2017 6:41:52 PM

### ambition, emotion

Robert's high ambition links him to Victor's vast scientific ambition, one of many affinities they will recognize in each other.

## jonklancher, 12/14/2017 7:00:37 PM

### paradise, religion, Milton, imagination, Hell, poetry

Walton's imagined "paradise" of his own making suggests the power of imagination, yet also the possibility of creating a Hell of one's own as well (Victor).

## jonklancher, 10/6/2017 5:43:55 PM

### natural philosophy

A key instrument for scientific experiment on gases, the first fully successful air-pump was created for Robert Boyle's experiments at the Royal Society in 1658. Victor's enthusiasm for a modern scientific instrument counterbalances his attraction to magic and pre-modern philosophy. For the wider significance of this invention, see Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, *Leviathan and the Air Pump* (1985).

## jonklancher, 10/6/2017 5:26:47 PM

### Switzerland, political philosophy, geography

Born in Geneva Switzerland, Victor is a potential hero insofar as he embodies the "republican" virtue's of Europe's only country, much admired by the Shelleys, which did not have a hereditary monarchy. By making Geneva so central to the novel's cultural geography, Mary Shelley also designates the relation between Victor's ambition and Jean Jacques Rousseau's world-making ambition in *Discourse on Inequality* among other works.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:47:05 PM

### geography, england

Victor's decision to tour the English countryside, rather than take the fastest road to Edinburgh, affords his party the chance to compare English geography to Europe's and they do so it considerable detail, beginning with this comparsion of the country around Matlock to Switzerland. Matlock was south of the industrial cities of Manchester and Leeds, but it is on the way to the Lake District in Victor's northern tour.


## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:40:26 PM

No university in Europe could have been more the opposite of the University of Ingolstadt (where Victor learned his science) than Oxford University, seat of theological learning and a holdout against any form of Enlightenment sciences. Victor also initially nostalgic for the days of Charles I when the absolute monarch was beleaguered in the early years of the English Revolution (1642-1659). He later praises the republican opponent of Charles I, John Hampden. What version of England's poltical past she means to commemorate in this chapter remains an interesting question.


## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:28:04 PM

### Goethe, Sorrows of Werther

The Creature clearly identifies himself with the hero of Goethe's novel *The Sorrows of Werther* but unlike many of its European readers, Werther is not a glamorous figure but an emblem of the Creature's own isolation and despair. On the relation of these novels, see also 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:05:17 PM

### Percy Shelley, poetry

This stanza from Percy Shelley's poem "Mutability" (1816)  may have helped convince readers of 1818 that the novel's author was indeed Percy rather than Mary, since it is not attributed to its author. But it also, of course, is far outside the novel's fictional eighteenth century setting. For more on the standing of poetry in the novel, see 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:02:25 PM

### family, empire

Victor's realization that his own pursuit of knowledge has weakened or damaged his "domestic affections" begins Shelley's extended argument on this question. But this passage on empire building as the greatest historical antagonist to domestic tranquillity suggests it is the ambition to dominate rather than "science" as such that destroys domestic life. See also 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 7:01:40 PM

By 1818 physiology had become a controversial branch of medicine at the center of the dispute between vitalism, the idea that a divine spark energized animal life, and materialism, the argument that chemical processes alone give rise to life. Mary Shelley was well aware of the dispute since the Shelleys' family doctor, William Lawrence, was vigorously taking up the materialist argument in works like *An Introduction to Comparative Anatomy and Physiology** (1816). For a full view of this controversy as it relates to the novel, see Marilyn Butler, "*Frankenstein* and Radical Science" [1993] reprinted in J. Paul Hunter, *Frankenstein,* Norton Critical Edition, second ed. (New York: Norton, 2012) 404-416.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:54:02 PM

### family

The death of Victor's mother, caused by her catching Elizabeth's scarlet fever, would lead in Victor's mind to a morbid association between the two women. It appears more vividly in Victor's nightmare in chapter XX, associated there with his first horror at beholding his creature. On the maternal and even incestuous dimensions of this passage, see also

### education, enlightenment, geography

Founded in 1472 in Bavaria, about 400 miles northeast of Geneva, this university became a leading center of scientific learning in the eighteenth century; the emergence of the Illuminati there in 1776 also identified it with the radical enlightenment. northeast of Geneva.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:46:05 PM

### lectures, natural philosophy, Humphry Davy

Far more than printed books, attendance at lectures on natural philosophy instructed thousands of eighteenth-century students of the sciences. Mary Shelley indirectly refers the reader to the vastly popular London lectures on the sciences to which audiences had been flocking since Humphry Davy's inaugural lectures in 1802. Anne Mellor has persuasively argued that Davy was a partial model for the character of Victor in this novel. But English scientific lectures were also widely printed through the eighteenth century before Davy's time. For a good example of published lectures Victor might have read in the later eighteenth century, see J. T. Desaguliers, *A Course of Experimental Philosophy,* (London, 1734-44).

### creature

The first sighting of the Creature in the Arctic, which shortly precedes the appearance of Victor. His "gigantic stature" will later be revealed as a height of about eight feet tall. This seemingly minor dimension of the Creature's power can be appreciated when we think about how few giants or outsized human figures appear in modern realism since the mid-18th century.  On this point, see Mark McGurl, GIANTS essay 

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:23:53 PM

### https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818.html, poetry, imagination

Walton's wish to be a poet, like Henry Clerval's taste for tales of romance, attest to their imaginativeness and greater capacity for sympathy than Victor, who has no literary interests, will show.  Victor also suggests that had his fate not turned out differently, he might have been a Henry Clerval. SEE chapter xx.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:22:48 PM

### north pole, arctic, religion

Robert imagines the cold North Pole as a sunny garden, suggesting a kind of Paradise as the destination toward which his scientific quest is moving. This is one of many affinities to Victor, whose fall into the profane knowledge of modern science, also links him to Adam's expulsion from the Garden of Eden.

## jonklancher, 8/23/2017 6:16:41 PM

### Erasmus Darwin, science, poetry

Erasmus Darwin, the evolutionist and poet hailing from Birmingham England, is clearly on Percy Shelley's mind when he introduces Mary's text in the 1818 edition. Critics of the novel have not often followed this lead in thinking about it as an early work in the British evolutionary imagination. Erasmus Darwin had made "not of impossible occurrence" that one presently visible species could mutate into another. Victor clearly contemplates this possibility--as an alarming pone--when he speculates in chapter XX that the Creature's demand that he create a "mate" could result in a new evolutionary development, "a race of devils."

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 7:11:55 PM

Given how often Wordsworth and Coleridge are quoted in the novel, it seems inevitable that Victor would tour the Lake Country in northern England, the scene of "Tintern Abbey" and many of the *Lyrical Ballads*, 

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:49:01 PM

### Malthus, population

Victor's frightening imagination of a "race of devils" that would be "propagated upon the earth" may owe something to fears of vast population increase in the wake of debates over Thomas Malthus's predictions in *An Essay on the Principle of Population* (1798), which were being fiercely debated (by Godwin and William Hazlitt among others) around the time of the novel's composition. See also Clara Tuite, "Frankenstein's Monster and Malthus's 'Jaundiced Eye': Population, Body Politics, and the Monstrous Sublime." *Eighteenth Century Life,* 22.1 (1998)

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:34:32 PM

Victor's admiration for John Hampden (1595-1643)--a leading English dissident opposing Charles I in the early years of the English Revolution--sits uneasily with his earlier nostalgia for the days of Charles I. Where the Creature had shown a consistent and clear sympathy with the radical Enlightenment, Victor seems as confused about the reactionary and progressive elements of the English past as he had about the modern and premodern versions of "natural philosophy" in the history of science. See also Iain Crawford, "Wading Through Slaughter: John Hampden, Thomas Gray, and Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*," *Studies in the Novel,* 20.3 (1988): 249-61.

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:34:04 PM

This is what Wordsworth says of his sister Dorothy in the final section of "Tintern Abbey"--she is an image of his former self, the one enraptured by the cataracts of 1793, his first visit to the Wye Valley, not the matured mind speaking in the poem of 1798. But now it is Victor who sees in Henry Clerval his own "former" and potential self--inquisitive and open to possibility, rather than the blasted tragic self Victor now sees himself as having become. 

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 6:34:03 PM

Victor could (possibly) have read "Tintern Abbey"(published in September 1798) within the novel's time frame. But the lines quoted here suggest Clerval is identified, not with the poet of 1798 who wrote this poem, but with the earlier moment in Wordsworth's genealogy when his senses were wholly absorbed in the sights and sounds of "nature"--and not yet with the "philosophic mind" that Wordsworth's poem makes the final stage of coming to poetiic powers. Clerval could not have been a Romantic poet, though his sensibilities might have made him one, had he not been killed by the Creature.

## jonklancher, 8/22/2017 5:45:35 PM

### Leigh Hunt, poetry, Romanticism

Victor quotes Leigh Hunt's poem "The Story of Rimini," published in 1816--a poem Victor could not, of course, have known in the novel's fictional time frame that ends in summer 1799. Like the passage from Percy Shelley's "Mutability," this line from Hunt's poem belongs to the novel's extra-diagetic address to readers of 1818 rather than to canons of novelistic realism. Clerval is once again made an avatar of the Romantic poet that by 1818 had become solidly esconced in the British cultural imaginary.





## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 8:19:14 PM

### novel

This is a reflexive moment in the novel when the Creature seems to have read something very much like the story Victor has told to Robert Walton in Volume 1--an account of what made him fabricate the Creature and its horrifying aftermath. 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 8:14:36 PM

Mary Shelley seems to confuse "Turk" with "Arab" here, and more generally her picture of Safie's father as both suffering Christian religious prejudices (against Muslims) and yet himself acting as a wily, untrustworthy figure seems to reflect "commonplaces of eighteenth-century liberalism," as Gayatri Spivak observes in *A Critique of Postcolonial Reason* (1999). 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:55:14 PM

### knowledge, empire, inequality

The Creature's story emphasizes the complex question of knowledge--how "strange" and contradictory it is to have, how "sorrow only increased with knowledge"--in ways that suggest it is drastically reductive to see in this novel only a warning against science.

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:40:45 PM

### sympathy, family

The eighteenth century British discourse of "sympathy" is especially vivid in the Creature's instinctive opening onto the emotions of others, echoing. as James Chandler shows, Adam Smith's arguments in *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759). 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:13:20 PM

### famly, domestic affections

The Creature first learns these figures by their family names of brother, sister, father, daughter as much as by their proper names, a sign that he is sensitive to "domestic affections"

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:12:03 PM

### John Milton, Paradise Lost, poetry

At this moment the Creature appears more strongly associated with Adam than with Satan, apparently born into a "paradise."

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:12:01 PM

### John Locke, empirical epistemology, education

The Creature's awakening to consciousness follows John Locke's account of how the mind slowly learns to distjnguish the various senses before it can apprehend the world.


## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 7:03:59 PM

### John Milton, poetry

This allusion to Milton's *Paradise Lost* puzzles some readers because the epigram of Volume II has previously quoted Adam's entreaty to God. Is the Creature more like Adam or more like the fallen angel Satan?

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 6:40:00 PM

### language

Clerval's love of languages, as opposed to the "minutiae of science," will later resonate with the Creature's perception that "language is a Godlike science." 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 6:39:43 PM

### orientalism

Both Cerval's mastery of foreign languages and his commercial activity in the "orient" (or Middle East) become a foil for the "natural philosophy" associated with Germany and northern Europe in the novel. 

## jonklancher, 8/19/2017 5:32:44 PM

### electricity, natural philosophy

Like the air-pump, recent experiments with electricity also fascinate Victor even while he reaches for a non-modern "system" that would be antithetical to empirical scientific reason.

## jonklancher, 5/23/2017 7:02:51 PM

### sister, family

Robert Walton's letters to his sister, Mrs. Saville, suggest he too, like Victor, has ambitious aims that conflict with his family member's sense of well being. She never appears as a character in the novel.

## jonklancher, 5/23/2017 6:53:37 PM

### domestic affection, family

The idea of "domestic affection" will be the most important virtue for Mary Shelley, one that is repeatedly violated by Victor Frankenstein's disregard of family responsibility, including the care of his own creation, the Creature.

## jonklancher, 5/23/2017 6:48:04 PM

### John Milton, poetry

(Percy) Shelley especially singles out Milton among the most important classic literature, indicating his strong influence in the novel

## jonklancher, 5/23/2017 6:33:43 PM

### Godwin, political philosophy

William Godwin was Mary Godwin's father, the leading radical political philosopher of the Romantic period.

## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 10:20:51 PM

### sympathy, moral philosophy

Throughout the novel Shelley appeals to moral philosophy's principle of sympathy, most fully argued in 
Adam Smith's *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759); Victor's failure to extend sympathy to his creature, by every reader's account, contributes to the ruin of both.

## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 4:18:06 PM

### poetry, Coleridge

This reference to Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," which becomes more explicit in the 1831 text, dates Walton's letters at summer 1799, less than a year after the poem's first publication in Lyrical Ballads (November 1798). 

## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 4:02:22 PM

### science

Magnetism, according to contemporary theories of electricity, was potentially the source of all life. Mary Shelley draws especially on the physiologist William Lawrence for this conjecture. Lawrence famously debated John Abernathy's vitalist account of a divine spark animating life by counterposing a materialist electrochemical thesis of life's origins.


## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 4:02:06 PM

### religion

These towns in Russia also indicate Walton's progression from the place of saints to the place of archangels on the "road" toward the site of God's ultimate creative powers at the pole, the site of magnetic power.

## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 3:59:14 PM

### arctic, north pole

The North Pole designates the physical place of magnetism. "North Sea" is likely synonym for Arctic Ocean.

## jonklancher, 4/5/2017 3:58:53 PM

"Those poets" likely included John Milton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and William Wordsworth, who are quoted throughout the novel.
