When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near <a
href="../V1notes/belrive.html">Belrive</a>, when we witnessed a most
violent and <a href="../V1notes/terrible.html">terrible thunder-storm</a>.
It advanced from behind the mountains of <a
href="../Places/jura.html">Jura</a>; and the thunder burst at once with
frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while
the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I
stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old
and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
remained but a <a href="../V1notes/blasted.html">blasted stump</a>. When
we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular
manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin
ribands of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.</p><p>

Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
<a href="../V1notes/electric.html">electricity</a>. On this occasion a 
man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by 
this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had 
formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new 
and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade 
Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my 
imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined 
me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would 
or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention 
suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we 
are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former 
occupations; set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed 
and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a 
would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of 
real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the <a 
href="../V1notes/math.html">mathematics</a>, 
and the branches of study appertaining to that science, as being built 
upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.<p>
