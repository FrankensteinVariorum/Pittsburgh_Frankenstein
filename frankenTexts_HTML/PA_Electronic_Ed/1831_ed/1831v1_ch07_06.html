<a href="../V1notes/ifear.html">I fear, my friend</a>, that I shall render myself tedious by
dwelling on these <a href="../V1notes/prelim.html">preliminary circumstances</a>; but they
were days
of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My
country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the
delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains,
and, more than all, thy lovely lake!<p>

Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.
Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark
mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a
vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was
destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I
prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance,
that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive
the hundredth part of the anguish <a href="../V1notes/wasdestin.html">I was destined</a>
to endure.<p>

It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates
of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at <a
href="../Places/secheron.html">Secheron</a>, a village at the distance of
half a league from the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to
rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been
murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the
lake in a boat to arrive at <a
href="../Places/plainpal.html">Plainpalais</a>.  During this short voyage
I saw the <a href="../V1notes/lightnin.html">lightnings</a> playing on the
summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to
approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might
observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon
felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly
increased.<p>
