A fever succeeded to this. <a href="../V3notes/twomonth.html">I
lay for two months</a> on the point of death: my ravings, as I
afterwards heard, were frightful; <a
href="../V3notes/callmyse.html">I called myself the murderer</a>
of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I
was tormented; and at others, I felt the fingers of the monster
already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and
terror. Fortunately, <a href="../V3notes/spokenat.html">as I
spoke my native language</a>, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but
my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the
other witnesses.</p><p>

Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before,
why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches
away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doating
parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in
the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and
the decay of the tomb! <a href="../V3notes/material.html">Of what
materials was I made</a>, that I could thus resist so many
shocks, which, <a href="../V3notes/turning.html">like the turning
of the wheel</a>, continually renewed the torture?</p><p>

But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as
awaking from a dream, <a href="../V3notes/prison.html">in a prison</a>,
stretched on a wretched bed,
surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable
apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus
awoke to understanding: I had forgotten the particulars of what
had happened, and only felt as if some great misfortune had
suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around, and saw the
barred windows, and the squalidness of the room in which I was,
all flashed across my memory, and I groaned bitterly.</p>
