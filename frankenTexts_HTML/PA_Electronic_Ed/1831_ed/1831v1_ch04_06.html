No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a
hurricane, in the first <a href="../V1notes/enthus1.html">enthusiasm</a>
of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should
first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A
new species would bless me as its <a
href="../V1notes/creator.html">creator and source</a>; many happy and
excellent natures would owe their being to me. <a
href="../V1notes/nopap.html">No father could claim the gratitude of his
child</a> so completely as I should deserve <a 
href="../V1notes/theirs.html">theirs</a>. Pursuing these
reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless
matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) <a
href="../V1notes/renew.html">renew life</a> where death had apparently
devoted the body to corruption.</p><p>

These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with
<a href="../V1notes/unremit.html">unremitting ardour</a>. My cheek had
grown pale with study, and <a href="../V1notes/emaciate.html">my person
had become emaciated with confinement</a>. Sometimes, on the very brink of
certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or
the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the
hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight
labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature
to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil, as
I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or <a 
href="../V1notes/tortured.html">tortured the living animal</a> to animate 
the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the 
remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic, impulse, urged 
me forward; <a href="../V1notes/lostsoul.html">I seemed to have lost all 
soul or sensation</a> but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing 
trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as,
the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old
habits. I collected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane
fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber,
or rather cell, at the top of the <a href="../Gifs/tower.html">house</a>,
and separated from all the other apartments by a <a
href="../V1notes/gallery.html">gallery</a> and staircase, I kept <a
href="../V1notes/workshop.html">my workshop of filthy creation</a>: my
eye-balls were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of
my employment. The <a href="../V1notes/dissect.html">dissecting room</a>
and the <a href="../V1notes/slaughtr.html">slaughter-house</a> furnished
many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing
from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which
perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.<p>
