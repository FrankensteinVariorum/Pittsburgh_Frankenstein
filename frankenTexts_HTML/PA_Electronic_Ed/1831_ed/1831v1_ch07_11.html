This was a <a href="../V1notes/astrange.html">strange tale</a>,
but it did not <a href="../V1notes/shakemy.html">shake my
faith</a>; and I replied earnestly, "You are all mistaken; I know
the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent."</p><p>

At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply
impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me
cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting,
would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster,
had not Ernest exclaimed, "Good God, papa! Victor says that he
knows who was the murderer of poor William."</p><p>

"We do also, unfortunately," replied my father; "for indeed I had
rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much <a
href="../V1notes/somuch.html">depravity and ingratitude</a> in one I
valued so highly."</p><p>

"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."</p><p>

"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is
to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will
be acquitted."</p><p>

This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine,
and indeed <a href="../V1notes/indeed.html">every human being</a>, was
guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any
circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict
her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would
be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except
I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
existence of <a href="../V1notes/presump.html">the living monument of
presumption</a> and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the
world?<p>
