My beloved Sister,<p>

I write to you, encompassed by peril, and ignorant whether I am ever
doomed to see again dear England, and the dearer friends that inhabit it. 
I am surrounded by mountains of ice, which admit of no escape, and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows, whom I have
persuaded to be my companions, look towards me for aid; but I have none to
bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my
courage and hopes do not desert me.  Yet it is terrible to reflect that
the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost, <a
href="../V3notes/madschem.html">my mad schemes are the cause</a>.<p>

And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? 
<a href="../V3notes/nothear.html">You will not hear</a> of my
destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will
pass, and you will have visitings of despair, and yet be
tortured by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening failing
of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible
to me than my own death. But you have
<a href="../V3notes/husband.html">a husband, and lovely
children</a>; you may be happy: Heaven bless you, and make you
so!<p>

My unfortunate guest regards me with <a href="../V3notes/compass.html">the 
tenderest compassion</a>. He endeavours to fill me with hope; and talks as if
life were a possession which he valued. He reminds me how often
the same accidents have happened to other navigators, who have
attempted this sea, and, in spite of myself, he fills me with
cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel <a 
href="../V3notes/eloquen2.html">the power of his eloquence</a>: 
when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their
energies, and, while they hear his voice, they believe these vast
mountains of ice are mole-hills, which will vanish before the
resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of
expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a
mutiny caused by this despair.<p>
