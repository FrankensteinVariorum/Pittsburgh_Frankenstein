<h2 align=center>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

"I <small>NOW</small> <a href="../V2notes/hasten.html">hasten</a>
to the <a href="../V2notes/moving.html">more moving part of my
story</a>. I shall relate events, that impressed me with <a
href="../V2notes/feelings.html">feelings which, from what I had
been, have made me what I am</a>.<p>

"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies
cloudless. It surprised me, that what before was desert and
gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and
verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand
scents of delight, and a thousand sights of beauty.<p>

"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically
rested from labour -- the old man played on his guitar, and the
children listened to him -- that I observed the countenance of
Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently; and
once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his
manner that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow. Felix
replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing
his music, when some one tapped at the door.<p>

"It was <a href="../V2notes/alady.html">a lady</a> on horseback,
accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was dressed in a
dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a
question; to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a
sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but
unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix
came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her
veil, and <a href="../V2notes/beauty.html">I beheld a countenance
of angelic beauty</a> and expression. Her hair of a shining raven
black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle,
although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her
complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely
pink.<p>
