It was in <a href="../V3notes/august.html">the latter end of
September</a> that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been
my own suggestion, and Elizabeth, therefore, acquiesced: but she
was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from
her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which
provided me a companion in Clerval -- and yet a man is blind to a
thousand minute circumstances, which call forth a woman's
sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return, -- a
thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute, as she bade me a
tearful silent farewell.<p>

I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away,
hardly knowing whither I was going, and <a
href="../V3notes/careless.html">careless of what was passing
around</a>.  I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish
that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments
should be packed to go with me. <a
href="../V3notes/filled.html">Filled with dreary
imaginations</a>, I passed through many beautiful and majestic
scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only
think of the <a href="../V3notes/bourne.html">bourne of my
travels</a>, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they
endured.<p>

After some days spent in <a
href="../V3notes/listles2.html">listless indolence</a>, during
which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I
waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the
contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when
he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he
beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me
the shifting colours of the landscape, and the appearances of the
sky. "This is what it is to live," he cried, "now I enjoy
existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you
desponding and sorrowful?" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
thoughts, and neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor
the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine. -- And <a
href="../V3notes/youmy.html">you, my friend</a>, would be far
more amused with the <a href="../V3notes/journal.html">journal of
Clerval</a>, who observed the scenery
with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my
reflections. I, a <a href="../V3notes/miswrtch.html">miserable
wretch</a>, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
enjoyment.<p>
