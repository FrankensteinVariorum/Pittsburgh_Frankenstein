<h2 align=center>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

M<small>Y</small> present situation was one in which all <a
href="../V3notes/voluntar.html">voluntary thought</a> was
swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by <a
href="../V3notes/fury.html">fury</a>; revenge alone endowed me
with strength and composure; <a
href="../V3notes/modelled.html">it moulded my feelings</a>, and
allowed me to be calculating and calm, at periods when otherwise
delirium or death would have been my portion.<p>

My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country,
which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my
adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with <a
href="../V3notes/summoney.html">a sum of money, together with a
few jewels</a> which had belonged to my mother, and departed.<p>

And now <a href="../V3notes/mywander.html">my wanderings</a>
began, <a href="../V3notes/tocease.html">which are to cease but
with life</a>. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth, and
have endured all the hardships which travellers, in <a
href="../V3notes/desbarb.html">deserts and barbarous
countries</a>, are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know;
many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy
plain, and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared
not die, and leave my adversary in being.<p>

When I quitted Geneva, my first labour was to gain some clue by
which I might trace the steps of <a
href="../V3notes/myfiend.html">my fiendish enemy</a>. But my plan
was unsettled; and I wandered many hours round the confines of
the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night
approached, I found myself <a href="../V3notes/cemetery.html">at the
entrance of the cemetery</a> where
William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it, and
approached the tomb which marked their graves. Every thing was
silent, except the leaves of the trees, which were gently
agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and the scene
would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
observer. <a href="../V3notes/spirits.html">The spirits of the
departed seemed to flit around</a>, and to cast a shadow, which
was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.<p>
