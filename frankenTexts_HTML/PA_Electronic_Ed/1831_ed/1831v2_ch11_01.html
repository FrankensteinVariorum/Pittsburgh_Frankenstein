<h2 >CHAPTER XI</h2> 
"I<small>T</small> is with considerable difficulty that I remember the <a href="../V2notes/original.html">original era of my being</a>: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange <a href="../V2notes/multipli.html">multiplicity of sensations</a> seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, <a href="../V2notes/descend.html">I believe, descended</a>; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but <a href="../V2notes/nowfound.html">I now found that I could wander on at liberty</a>, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.  The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p><p> 
"It was dark when I awoke; <a href="../V2notes/feltcold.html">I felt cold also</a>, and half-frightened, as it were <a href="../V2notes/instinct.html">instinctively, finding myself so desolate</a>. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes; but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, <a href="../V2notes/iwasapor.html">miserable wretch</a>; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, <a href="../V2notes/isatdown.html">I sat down and wept</a>.</p>
