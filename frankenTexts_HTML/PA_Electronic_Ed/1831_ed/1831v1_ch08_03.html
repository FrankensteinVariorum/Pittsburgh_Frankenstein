She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the
evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house
of an aunt at Ch&ecirc;ne, a village situated at about a <a
href="../V1notes/aleague.html">league</a> from Geneva. On her return, at
about nine o'clock, she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing
of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account, and passed
several hours in looking for him, when the <a
href="../V1notes/thegates.html">gates of Geneva</a> were shut, and she was
forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a
cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
known. Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she
believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her,
and she awoke. It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she
might again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot
where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been
bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since
she had passed a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was yet
uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account.</p><p>

"I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally this one
circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and
when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture
concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my
pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that <a
href="../V1notes/noenemy.html">I have no enemy on earth</a>, and none
surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the
murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded <a
href="../V1notes/him.html">him</a> for so doing; or, if I had, why should
he have stolen the jewel, <a href="../V1notes/topart.html">to part with it
again so soon</a>?<p>
