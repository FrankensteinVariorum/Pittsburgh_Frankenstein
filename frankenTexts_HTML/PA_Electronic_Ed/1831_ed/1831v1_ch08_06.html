This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?
Had my eyes deceived me? and was I really as mad as the whole
world would believe me to be, if I disclosed the object of my
suspicions? I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly
demanded the result.<p>

"My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected;
<a href="../V1notes/alljudge.html">all judges</a> had rather that
ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should escape.
But she has confessed."<p>

This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with
firmness upon Justine's innocence. "Alas!" said she, "how shall I
ever again believe in <a href="../V1notes/humanben.html">human
goodness</a>? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister,
how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet
she has committed a murder."<p>

Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
cousin. <a href="../V1notes/myfather.html">My father wished her not to
go</a>; but said, that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to
decide. "Yes," said Elizabeth, "I will go, although she is guilty; and
you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go alone." The idea of this
visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.<p>

We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine
sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were
manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us
enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at
the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.<p>

"Oh, Justine!" said she, "why did you rob me of my last
consolation? I relied on your innocence; and although I was then
very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now."<p>
