"Last <a href="../V1notes/thursday.html">Thursday (May 7th)</a> I, my niece, and your two
brothers,
went to walk in <a href="../Places/plainpal.html">Plainpalais</a>. The
evening was warm
and serene, and
we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk
before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that
William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.
We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.
Presently <a href="../V1notes/ernest1.html">Ernest</a> came, and inquired if we had seen
his brother:
he said, he had been playing with him, that William had
run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
afterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not
return.<p>

"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search
for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he
might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned
again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my
sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and
dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About
five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night
before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the
grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer's finger
was on his neck.<p>

"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very
earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her;
but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily
examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands
exclaimed, 'O God! I have murdered my darling child!'<p>
