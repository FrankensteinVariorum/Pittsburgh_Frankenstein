This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair
beside me. She was <a href="../V3notes/hirenurs.html">a hired
nurse</a>, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance
expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise <a
href="../V3notes/thatclas.html">that class</a>. The lines of her
face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see
without sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her
entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice
struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings:--<p>

"Are you better now, sir?" said she.</p><p>

I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, "I
believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I
am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror."</p><p>

"For that matter," replied the old woman, "if you mean about the gentleman
you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for
I fancy it will go hard with you!  However, that's none of my business; I
am sent to nurse you, and get you well; I do my duty with a safe
conscience; it were well if every body did the same."</p><p>

I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter <a
href="../V3notes/sounfeel.html">so unfeeling a speech</a> to a
person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid,
and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of
my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed
it were all true, for <a href="../V3notes/reality.html">it never
presented itself to my mind with the force of reality</a>.</p><p>

As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I
grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me: no one was near me
who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand
supported me. The physician came and prescribed medicines, and
the old woman prepared them for me; but <a
href="../V3notes/uttercar.html">utter carelessness</a> was
visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was
strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be
interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who would
gain his fee?</p>
