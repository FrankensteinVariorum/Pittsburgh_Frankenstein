"'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food; it is
warmth and rest only that I need.'<p>

"I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute
was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to
commence the interview; when the old man addressed me--<p>

"'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman;
-- <a href="../V2notes/french.html">are you French?</a>'<p>

"'No; but I was educated by a French family, and understand
that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of
some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have
some hopes.'<p>

"'Are they Germans?'<p>

"'No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate
and deserted creature; I look around, and <a
href="../V2notes/relation.html">I have no relation or friend upon
earth</a>. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me, and know
little of me. I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am an
outcast in the world for ever.'<p>

"'Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate; but <a
href="../V2notes/hearts.html">the hearts of men</a>, when unprejudiced by
any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely,
therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do
not despair.'<p>

"'They are kind -- they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good
dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless, and in some degree
beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought
to see <a href="../V2notes/friend.html">a feeling and kind friend</a>,
they behold only <a href="../V2notes/detest.html">a detestable
monster</a>.'<p>
