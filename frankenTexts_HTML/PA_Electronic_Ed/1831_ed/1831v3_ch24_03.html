I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but <a
href="../V3notes/thedevil.html">the devil</a> eluded my grasp. <a
href="../V3notes/moondisk.html">Suddenly the broad disk of the
moon arose</a>, and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted
shape, as he fled with more than mortal speed.</p><p>

I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided
by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but
vainly. <a href="../V3notes/bluemed.html">The blue Mediterranean
appeared</a>; and, by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by
night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I
took my passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not
how.</p><p>

Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still
evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the
peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his
path; sometimes he himself, <a href="../V3notes/whofear.html">who
feared that if I lost all trace of him, I should despair and die</a>,
left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head,
and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. <a
href="../V3notes/toyou.html">To you first entering on life</a>,
to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can you understand
what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were
the least pains which I was destined to endure; <a
href="../V3notes/curshell.html">I was cursed by some devil, and
carried about with me my eternal hell</a>; yet still <a
href="../V3notes/spirgood.html">a spirit of good</a> followed and
directed my steps, and, when I most murmured, would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.
Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the
exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert, that
restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as
the peasants of the country ate; but I will not doubt that it was
set there by <a href="../V3notes/spirinvo.html">the spirits that
I had invoked to aid me</a>. Often, when all was dry, the heavens
cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would
bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.</p>
