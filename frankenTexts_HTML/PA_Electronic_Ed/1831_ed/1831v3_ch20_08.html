I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when
I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.
The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the
safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was north-east,
and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had
embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found
that, if I again made the attempt, the boat would be instantly
filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive
before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of
terror. I had no compass with me, and was so slenderly acquainted
with the geography of this part of the world, that the sun was of
little benefit to me. <a href="../V3notes/atlantic.html">I might
be driven into the wide Atlantic</a>, and feel all the tortures
of starvation, or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that
roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours,
and <a href="../V3notes/feltsuff.html">felt the torment of a
burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings</a>. I looked on
the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the
wind, only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea, <a
href="../V3notes/mygrave.html">it was to be my grave</a>.
"Fiend," I exclaimed, "your task is already fulfilled!" I thought
of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; all left behind, on whom
the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.  This
idea plunged me into a reverie, so despairing and frightful, that even
now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I
shudder to reflect on it.</p><p>

Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined
towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and
the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a
heavy swell; I felt sick, and hardly able to hold the rudder,
when suddenly I saw a <a href="../V3notes/highland.html">line of
high land</a> towards the south.<p>
