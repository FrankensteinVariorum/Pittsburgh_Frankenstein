<h2 align=center>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

T<small>HE</small> voyage came to an end. We landed, and
proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my
strength, and that I must repose before I could continue my
journey. My father's care and attentions were indefatigable; but
he did not know the origin of my sufferings, and sought erroneous
methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek
amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not
abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt
attracted <a href="../V3notes/repulsiv.html">even to the most
repulsive among them</a>, as to creatures of an angelic nature
and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share
their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them, whose joy
it was to shed their blood, and to revel in their groans. How
they would, each and all, abhor me, and hunt me from the world,
did they know my unhallowed acts, and the crimes which had their
source in me!<p>

My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society, and
strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he
thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to
answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the
futility of pride.<p>

"Alas! my father," said I, "<a href="../V3notes/howlit.html">how
little do you know me</a>. Human beings, their feelings and
passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt
pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and
she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause
of this -- I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry -- <a
href="../V3notes/myhands.html">they all died by my hands</a>."<p>

My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had
presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved
in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and maintained a continual
silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that <a
href="../V3notes/mad.html">I should be supposed mad</a>, and this in
itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not
bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with
consternation, and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his
breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy, and was
silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal
secret. Yet still words like those I have recorded, would burst
uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them; but their
truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.<p>
