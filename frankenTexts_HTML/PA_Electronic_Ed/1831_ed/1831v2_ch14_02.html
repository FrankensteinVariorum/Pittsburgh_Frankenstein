"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were
uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that
moment, a <a href="../V2notes/solemn.html">solemn vow to deliver him</a>,
and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to
gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the
unfortunate Mahometan; who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night, and
made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed
and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises
of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt; yet when he
saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father, and who, by her
gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning
to his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully
reward his toil and hazard.</p><p>

"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on
the heart of Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his
interests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be
conveyed to a place of safety. <a href="../V2notes/delicate.html">Felix
was too delicate to accept this offer</a>; yet he looked forward to the
probability of the event as to that consummation of his happiness.</p><p>

"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going
forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was
warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl,
who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her
lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father, who
understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for
his intended services towards her parent; and at the same time
deeply deplored her own fate.</p>
