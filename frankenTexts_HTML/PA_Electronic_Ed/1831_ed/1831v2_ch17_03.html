I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my
consent; but I felt that there was some <a
href="../V2notes/justice2.html">justice</a> in his argument. His tale, and
the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be <a
href="../V2notes/creatsen.html">a creature of fine sensations</a>; and did
I not as his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in
my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling, and continued--<p>

"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us
again: <a href="../V2notes/america.html">I will go to the vast wilds of
South America</a>. My food is not that of man; <a
href="../V2notes/nourish.html">I do not destroy the lamb and the kid</a>
to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.
My companion will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content
with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will
shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to
you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only
in the <a href="../V2notes/wanton.html">wantonness of power</a> and
cruelty.  Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see <a
href="../V2notes/compass3.html">compassion</a> in your eyes; let me seize
the favourable moment, and persuade you to promise what <a
href="../V2notes/isoard.html">I so ardently desire</a>."<p>

"You propose," replied I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in
those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions.
How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this
exile? You will return, and again seek their kindness, and you will meet
with their detestation; <a href="../V2notes/evilpass.html">your evil
passions</a> will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid
you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point,
for I cannot consent."<p>
