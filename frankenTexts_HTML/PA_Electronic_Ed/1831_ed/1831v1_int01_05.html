But <a href="../V1notes/wetsummr.html">it proved a wet, ungenial
summer</a>, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house. 
<a href="../V1notes/somevols.html">Some volumes of ghost stories</a>,
translated from the German into French,
fell into our hands.  There was the <a
href="../EtAlia/td41.html">History of the Inconstant Lover</a>, who,
when he thought to clasp the bride to whom he had pledged his vows, found
himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her whom he had deserted.  There
was the <a href="../EtAlia/td11.html">tale of the sinful founder of his
race</a>, whose miserable doom it
was to bestow the kiss of death on all the younger sons of his fated
house, just when they reached the age of promise.  His gigantic, shadowy
form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet, in complete armour, but with the
beaver up, was seen at midnight, by the moon's fitful beams, to advance
slowly along the gloomy avenue.  The shape was lost beneath the shadow of
the castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a step was heard, the door
of the chamber opened, and he advanced to the couch of the blooming
youths, cradled in healthy sleep.  Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he
bent down and kissed the forehead of the boys, who from that hour withered
like flowers snapt upon the stalk.  I have not seen these stories since
then; but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as if I had read them
yesterday.</p>
