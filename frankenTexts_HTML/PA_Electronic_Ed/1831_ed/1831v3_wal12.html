I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? <a 
href="../V3notes/midnight.html">It is
midnight</a>; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely
stir. Again; there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser;
it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still
lie. I must arise, and examine. Good night, my sister.<p>

Great God! <a href="../V3notes/scene.html">what a scene has just taken 
place</a>! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether 
I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would
be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.<p>

I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and
admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words
to describe; gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in
its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was
concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but <a 
href="../V3notes/vasthand.html">one vast 
hand was extended</a>, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.
When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter
exclamations of grief and horror, and sprung towards the window.
Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such
loathsome, yet appalling hideousness. <a href="../V3notes/shuteyes.html">I 
shut my eyes involuntarily</a>,
and endeavoured to recollect <a href="../V3notes/myduties.html">what were my 
duties</a> with regard to this destroyer. <a 
href="../V3notes/icalled.html">I called on him to stay</a>.<p>

He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning
towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my
presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by <a 
href="../V3notes/rage.html">the wildest rage of some uncontrollable 
passion</a>.<p>

"That is also my victim!" he exclaimed: "in his murder my crimes are
consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh,
Frankenstein! <a href="../V3notes/generous.html">generous and self-devoted
being</a>! what does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who
irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovest. Alas! he is
cold, he cannot answer me."<p>
