These were my first reflections; but I soon learned that Mr.
Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room
in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the
best); and <a href="../V3notes/itwashe.html">it was he who had
provided a physician and a nurse</a>. It is true, he seldom came
to see me; for, although he ardently desired to relieve the
sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present
at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He came,
therefore, sometimes, to see that I was not neglected; but his
visits were short, and with long intervals.</p><p>

One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a
chair, <a href="../V3notes/myeyes.html">my eyes half open, and my
cheeks livid like those in death</a>. I was overcome by gloom and
misery, and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to
remain <a href="../V3notes/mispent.html">in a world which to me
was replete with wretchedness</a>. At one time I
considered whether I should not declare myself guilty, and suffer
the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.
Such were my thoughts, when the door of my apartment was opened,
and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and
compassion; he drew a chair close to mine, and <a
href="../V3notes/adfrench.html">addressed me in French</a>--<p>

"I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do
any thing to make you more comfortable?"</p><p>

"I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on
the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of
receiving."</p><p>

"I know that <a href="../V3notes/sympstra.html">the sympathy of a
stranger</a> can be but of little relief to one borne down as you
are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit
this melancholy abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily be
brought to free you from the criminal charge."</p>
