"And now, with the world before me, <a
href="../V2notes/steps.html">whither should I bend my steps?</a> I
resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and
despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of
you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were <a 
href="../V2notes/myfather.html">my father</a>,
my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who
had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie,
geography had not been omitted: I had learned from these the relative
situations of the different countries of the earth. You had mentioned
Geneva as the name of your native town; and towards this place I resolved
to proceed.</p><p>

"But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a
south-westerly direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my only
guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through,
nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not
despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I
felt no sentiment but that of hatred. <a
href="../V2notes/unfeelin.html">Unfeeling, heartless creator!</a> you had
endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then cast me abroad an
object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any
claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that <a
href="../V2notes/justice.html">justice</a> which I vainly attempted to
gain from any other being that wore the human form.<p>
