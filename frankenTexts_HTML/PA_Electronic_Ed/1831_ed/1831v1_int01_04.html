After this my life became busier, and reality stood in place of fiction. 
<a href="../PShelley/pshelley.html">My husband</a>, however, was from the
first, very anxious that I should prove myself <a
href="../V1notes/worthy.html">worthy of my parentage</a>, and enrol myself
on the page of fame.  He was for ever inciting me to obtain literary
reputation, which even on my own part I cared for then, though since I
have become infinitely indifferent to it.  At this time he desired that I
should write, not so much with the idea that I could produce any thing
worthy of notice, but that he might himself judge how far I possessed the
promise of better things hereafter.  Still I did nothing.  Travelling, and
the cares of a family, occupied my time; and study, in the way of reading,
or improving my ideas in communication with his far more cultivated mind,
was all of literary employment that engaged my attention.</p><p>

In the <a href="../MShelley/summer16.html">summer of 1816</a>, we visited
Switzerland, and <a href="../V1notes/neighbor.html">became the
neighbours</a>
of <a
href="../Byron/byron.html">Lord Byron</a>. At first we spent
our pleasant hours on the lake, or wandering on its shores; and Lord
Byron, who was writing the <a href="../V1notes/canto3.html">third canto of
Childe Harold</a>, was the only one
among us who put his thoughts upon paper.  These, as he brought them
successively to us, clothed in all the light and harmony of poetry, seemed
to stamp as divine the glories of heaven and earth, whose influences we
partook with him.<p>
