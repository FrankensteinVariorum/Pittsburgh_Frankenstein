From thence we proceeded to <a href="../Places/oxford.html">Oxford</a>. As
we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the
<a href="../V3notes/events.html">events</a> that had been transacted there
more than a century and a half
before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city
had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his
cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory of that
unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable <a
href="../V3notes/falkland.html">Falkland</a>, the insolent <a
href="../V3notes/gower.html">Goring</a>, <a
href="../V3notes/queen.html">his queen, and son</a>, gave a peculiar
interest to every part of the city, which they might be supposed to have
inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we
delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an
imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself
sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and
picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent;  and the lovely <a
href="../V3notes/isis.html">Isis</a>, which flows beside it through
meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of
waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
domes, embosomed among aged trees.</p><p>

I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by
the memory of the past, and the anticipation of the future. I was
formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent
never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by
<i>ennui</i>, the sight of what is <a
href="../V3notes/beautnat.html">beautiful in nature</a>, or the
study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man,
could always interest my heart, and communicate elasticity to my
spirits. But <a href="../V3notes/blasted.html">I am a blasted
tree</a>; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I
should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to be -- a
miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and
intolerable to myself.<p>
