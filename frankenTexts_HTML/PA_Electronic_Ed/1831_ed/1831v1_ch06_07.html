Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed
for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents,
winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed <a
href="../V1notes/roads.html">impassable</a>, and my journey was retarded
until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to
see my native town and my beloved friends. My return had only been
delayed so long, from an <a href="../V1notes/unwillin.html">unwillingness
to leave Clerval</a> in a strange place, before he had become acquainted
with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;
and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came, its beauty
compensated for its dilatoriness.</p><p>

The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the
letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when
Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt,
that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long
inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was
fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite
companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among
the scenes of my native country.<p>
