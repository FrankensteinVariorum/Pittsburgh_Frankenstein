Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to
which I was a devout but nearly silent listener.  During one of these,
various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the
nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability of
its ever being discovered and communicated.  They talked of the
experiments of <a href="../Darwin/darwin.html">Dr. Darwin</a>, (I speak
not of what the Doctor really did, or said that he did, but, as more to my
purpose, of what was then spoken of as having been done by him,) who
preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till by some
extraordinary means <a href="../V1notes/vermicel.html">it began to move
with voluntary motion</a>. Not thus, after all, would life be given. 
Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated; <a
href="../V1notes/galvanis.html">galvanism had given token of such
things</a>: perhaps the component parts of a creature might be
manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth.</p>
