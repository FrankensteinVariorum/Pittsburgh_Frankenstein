"I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind intentions towards <a
href="../V3notes/miserabl.html">so miserable a wretch</a>; but when you
speak of new ties, and fresh affections, think you that any can replace
those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was; or any woman
another Elizabeth? Even where <a href="../V3notes/affect.html">the
affections</a> are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the
companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds,
which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine
dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never
eradicated;  and they can judge of our actions with more certain
conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. <a
href="../V3notes/sister.html">A sister or a brother</a> can never, unless
indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or
false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached,
may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed
friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own
merits; and, wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth, and the
conversation of Clerval, will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead;
and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my
life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with
extensive utility to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.
But <a href="../V3notes/mydestin.html">such is not my destiny</a>; I must
pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on
earth will be fulfilled, and I may die."</p></p>
