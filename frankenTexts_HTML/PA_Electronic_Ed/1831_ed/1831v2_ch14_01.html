<h2 >CHAPTER XIV</h2> 
"S<small>OME</small> time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p><p> 
"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. <a href="../V2notes/hisson.html">His son was bred in the service of his country</a>; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p><p> 
"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became <a href="../V2notes/obnox.html">obnoxious to the government</a>. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that <a href="../V2notes/safiearr.html">Safie arrived from Constantinople</a> to join him. <a href="../V2notes/condemn.html">He was tried, and condemned to death</a>. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime alleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation.</p>
