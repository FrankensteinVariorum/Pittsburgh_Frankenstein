<p>

But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the
absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil.  <a
href="../V1notes/friend.html">I have no friend</a>, Margaret: when I am
glowing with the <a href="../V1notes/enthu.html">enthusiasm of
success</a>, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by
disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall
commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the
<a href="../V1notes/commune.html">communication</a> of feeling. I desire
the company of a man who could sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply
to mine. You may deem me <a href="../V1notes/romantic.html">romantic</a>,
my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one
near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a
capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my
plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! <a
href="../V1notes/ardent.html">I am too ardent</a> in execution, and too
impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am
<a href="../V1notes/educate.html">self-educated</a>: for the first
fourteen years of my life I ran <a href="../V1notes/wild.html">wild on a
common</a>, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At
that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; 
but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most
important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity
of becoming <a href="../V1notes/language.html">acquainted with more
languages</a> than that of my native country. Now I am <a
href="../V1notes/twtyeght.html">twenty-eight</a>, and am in reality more
illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought
more, and that my <a href="../V1notes/daydrea2.html">day dreams</a> are
more extended and magnificent; but they want (as the painters call it) <a
href="../V1notes/keeping.html"><i>keeping</i></a>;  and I greatly need a
friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and
affection enough for me to endeavour to <a
href="../V1notes/regulate.html">regulate my mind</a>.</p>
