"Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter, "I will
write instantly, and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel." I
wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had
commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to
leave my chamber.</p><p>

One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of
rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever
since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my
misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of <a
href="../V1notes/natphil.html">natural philosophy</a>. When I was
otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument
would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had
removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment;
for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no
avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he 
praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in 
the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but, not 
guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and 
changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself, with a 
desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant 
to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one 
by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in 
putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet 
dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were 
always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the 
subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation 
took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but <a 
href="../V1notes/ididnot.html">I did not speak</a>. I saw plainly that he 
was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and 
although <a href="../V1notes/ilovedhm.html">I loved him with a mixture of 
affection and reverence that knew no bounds</a>, yet I could never 
persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present 
to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only 
impress more deeply.<p>
