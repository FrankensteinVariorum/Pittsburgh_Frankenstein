I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer
from a stranger; and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the
frowning and angry countenances of his companions. "Why do you
answer me so roughly?" I replied; "surely it is not the custom of
Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably."<p>

"I do not know," said the man, "what the custom of the English
may be; but it is the custom of <a
href="../V3notes/irish.html">the Irish</a> to hate villains."<p>

While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd
rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity
and anger, which annoyed, and in some degree alarmed me. I
inquired the way to the inn; but no one replied. I then moved
forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they
followed and surrounded me; when an ill-looking man approaching,
tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Come, Sir, you must follow
me to Mr. Kirwin's, to give an account of yourself."<p>

"Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is
not this a free country?"<p>

"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a
magistrate; and you are to give an account of the death of a
gentleman who was found murdered here last night."<p>

This answer startled me; but I presently recovered myself. I
was innocent; that could easily be proved: accordingly I followed
my conductor in silence, and was led to one of the best houses in
the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger; but, being
surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my
strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the
calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me, and
extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.<p>

I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to recall the
memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, <a
href="../V3notes/detail.html">in proper detail</a>, to my
recollection.<p>
