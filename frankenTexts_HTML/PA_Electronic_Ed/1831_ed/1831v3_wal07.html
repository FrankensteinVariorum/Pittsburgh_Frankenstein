This speech troubled me. I had not despaired; nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could I, <a href="../V3notes/justice.html">in justice, or even in possibility</a>, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and, indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said--</p><p> 
"What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was <a href="../V3notes/smooth.html">smooth and placid as a southern sea</a>, but because it was full of dangers and terror; because, at every new incident, your fortitude was to be called forth, and your courage exhibited;  because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the <a href="../V3notes/benefact.html">benefactors of your species</a>; your name adored, as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour, and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away, and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far, and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! <a href="../V3notes/bemen.html">be men</a>, or be more than men. <a href="../V3notes/besteady.html">Be steady</a> to your purposes, and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable, and cannot withstand you, if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return, as heroes who have fought and conquered, and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe."</p>
