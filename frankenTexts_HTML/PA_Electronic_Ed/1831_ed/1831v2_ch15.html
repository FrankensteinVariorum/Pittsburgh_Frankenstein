<h2 align=center>CHAPTER XV</h2>

"S<small>UCH</small> was the history of my beloved cottagers. It
impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of social life
which it developed, to admire their virtues, and to deprecate the
vices of mankind.<p>

"As yet <a href="../V2notes/evil.html">I looked upon crime as a
distant evil</a>; benevolence and generosity were ever present
before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the
busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth
and displayed. But, in giving an account of the progress of my
intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the
beginning of the month of August of the same year.<p>

"One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood,
where I collected my own food, and brought home firing for my
protectors, I found on the ground a leathern <a
href="../V2notes/port.html">portmanteau</a>, containing several
articles of dress and some <a
href="../V2notes/books.html">books</a>. I eagerly seized the
prize, and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books
were <a href="../V2notes/language.html">written in the
language</a>, the elements of which I had acquired at the
cottage; they consisted of 'Paradise Lost,' a volume of '<a
href="../V2notes/plutarch.html">Plutarch's Lives</a>,' and the
'<a href="../V2notes/werter.html">Sorrows of Werter</a>.' The
possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now
continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories,
whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.<p>
