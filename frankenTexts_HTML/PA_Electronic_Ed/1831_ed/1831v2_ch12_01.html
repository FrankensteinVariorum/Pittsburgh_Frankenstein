<h2 >CHAPTER XII</h2> 
"I <small>LAY</small> on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people; and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present <a href="../V2notes/resolved.html">I would remain quietly in my hovel</a>, watching, and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.</p><p> 
"The cottagers arose the next morning <a href="../V2notes/beforsun.html">before the sun</a>. The young woman arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed after the first meal.</p><p> 
"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the <a href="../V2notes/loveresp.html">love and respect</a> which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.</p>
