<p align="right">August 19, 17--.</p>

Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain
Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had
determined, at one time, that the memory of these evils should die with
me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for <a
href="../V1notes/knowledg.html">knowledge</a> and wisdom, as I once did;
and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a
serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of
my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are
pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have
rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my
tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking, and
console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of <a
href="../V1notes/marvel.html">occurrences which are usually deemed
marvellous</a>. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature, I might fear to
encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will
appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions, which would provoke
the laughter of those unacquainted with <a
href="../V1notes/nature1.html">the ever-varied powers of nature</a>: --
nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence
of the <a href="../V1notes/mytale.html">truth</a> of the events of which
it is composed."</p><p>

You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered
communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a
recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the
promised narrative, partly from <a
href="../V1notes/curiosit.html">curiosity</a>, and partly from a strong
desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these 
feelings in my answer.</p>
