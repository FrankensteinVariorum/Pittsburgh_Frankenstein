<h2 align=center>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

"<a href="../V2notes/cursed2.html">C<small>URSED</small>, cursed
creator!</a> Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not
extinguish the spark of existence which you had <a
href="../V2notes/bestowed.html">so wantonly bestowed</a>? I know
not;  despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings
were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have
destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants, and have glutted
myself with their shrieks and misery.<p>

"When night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood;
and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave
vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. <a
href="../V2notes/beast.html">I was like a wild beast</a> that had
broken the toils; destroying the objects that obstructed me, and
ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. O! what a
miserable night I passed! the cold stars shone in mockery, and
the bare trees waved their branches above me: now and then the
sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness.
All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment: <a
href="../V2notes/hellwith.html">I, like the arch-fiend, bore a
hell within me</a>; and, finding myself <a
href="../V2notes/unsymp.html">unsympathised with</a>, wished to
tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and
then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.<p>

"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I
became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion, and sank on the
damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among
the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and
should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No: from that moment I
<a href="../V2notes/declared.html">declared everlasting war</a>
against the species, and, more than all, against him who had
formed me, and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.<p>

"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was
impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I
hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the
ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.<p>
