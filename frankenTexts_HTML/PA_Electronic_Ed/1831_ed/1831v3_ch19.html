<h2 align=center>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

L<small>ONDON</small> was our present point of rest; we
determined to remain several months in this wonderful and
celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of
genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with
me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means
of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my
promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of
introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the <a
href="../V3notes/mostdist.html">most distinguished natural
philosophers</a>.<p>

If this journey had taken place during my days of study and
happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But
a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these
people for the sake of the information they might give me on the
subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. <a
href="../V3notes/irksome.html">Company was irksome to me</a>;
when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and
earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat
myself into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous
faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable
barrier placed between me and my fellow-men; this barrier was
sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to reflect on
the events connected with those names filled my soul with
anguish.<p>

But in Clerval I saw <a href="../V3notes/formself.html">the image
of my former self</a>; he was inquisitive, and anxious to gain
experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he
observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and
amusement.  He was also pursuing an
object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in
the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages,
and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of
materially assisting <a href="../V3notes/colonise.html">the progress of
European colonisation</a> and
trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his
plan.  He was for ever busy; and the only check to his
enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. <a
href="../V3notes/trytocon.html">I tried to conceal</a> this as
much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures
natural to one, who was entering on a new scene of life,
undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused
to accompany him, alleging another engagement, <a
href="../V3notes/remalone.html">that I might remain alone</a>. I
now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new
creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of
water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was
devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke
in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to
palpitate.<p>
