"Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and
fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn
when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the
bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the
endurance of cold than heat. But my <a
href="../V2notes/delights.html">chief delights</a> were the sight of the
flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted
me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness
was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved, and sympathised 
with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not 
interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw 
of them, <a href="../V2notes/desire.html">the greater became my 
desire</a> to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be 
known and loved by these amiable creatures: to see their sweet looks 
directed towards me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition. 
I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and 
horror. The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I 
asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: <a
href="../V2notes/kindsymp.html">I required kindness and sympathy</a>; but
I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.</p><p>

"The winter advanced, and <a href="../V2notes/oneyear.html">an entire
revolution</a> of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. My
attention, at this time, was solely directed towards my plan of
introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many
projects; but that on which I finally fixed was, to enter the dwelling
when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover,
that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror
with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had
nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if, in the absence of
his children, I could gain <a href="../V2notes/goodwill.html">the
good-will and mediation of the old De Lacey</a>, I might, by his means, be
tolerated by my younger protectors.<p>
