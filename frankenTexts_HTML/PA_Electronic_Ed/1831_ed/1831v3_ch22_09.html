Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly
to calm her mind. But on the day that was to <a
href="../V3notes/fulfill.html">fulfil my wishes and my
destiny</a>, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil
pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful
secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following
day. My father was in the mean time overjoyed, and, in the bustle
of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the
diffidence of a bride.</p><p>

After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my
father's; but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence
our journey by water, sleeping that night at <a
href="../V3notes/evian.html">Evian</a>, and
continuing our voyage on the following day. the day was fair, the
wind favourable, all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.</p><p>

Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling
of happiness. We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were
sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy, while we enjoyed the beauty
of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw <a
href="../V3notes/saleve.html">Mont Sal&ecirc;ve</a>, the pleasant banks of
Montal&egrave;gre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont
Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to
emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty <a
href="../V3notes/jura.html">Jura opposing its dark side</a> to the
ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable
barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.</p><p>

I took the hand of Elizabeth: "You are sorrowful, my love.
Ah! if you knew what I have suffered, and what I may yet endure,
you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from
despair, that this one day at least permits me to enjoy."<p>
