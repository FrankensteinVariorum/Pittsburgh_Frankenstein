Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can,
even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to <a
href="../V1notes/enterpri.html">this great enterprise</a>. I commenced by
inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several
expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst,
and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during
the day, and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of
medicine, and those branches of <a
href="../V1notes/physical.html">physical science</a> from which a naval
adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually
hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself
to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered
me the <a href="../V1notes/second.html">second dignity</a> in the vessel,
and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did
he consider my services.<p>

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred <a
href="../V1notes/glory.html">glory</a> to every enticement that <a
href="../V1notes/wealth.html">wealth</a> placed in my path. Oh, that some
encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My <a
href="../V1notes/courage.html">courage</a> and my <a
href="../V1notes/resolute.html">resolution</a> is <a
href="../V1notes/firm.html">firm</a>; but my hopes fluctuate, and my
spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult
voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am
required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain
my own, when theirs are failing.<p>
