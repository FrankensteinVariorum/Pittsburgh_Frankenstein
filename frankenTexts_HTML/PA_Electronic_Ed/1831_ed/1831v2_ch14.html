<h2 align=center>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

"S<small>OME</small> time elapsed before I learned the history of
my friends. It was one which could not fail to impress itself
deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances,
each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as
I was.<p>

"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a
good family in France, where he had lived for many years in
affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals.
<a href="../V2notes/hisson.html">His son was bred in the service
of his country</a>; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the
highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had
lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by
friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue,
refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate
fortune, could afford.<p>

"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a
Turkish merchant, and had inhabited Paris for many years, when,
for some reason which I could not learn, he became <a
href="../V2notes/obnox.html">obnoxious to the government</a>. He
was seized and cast into prison the very day that <a
href="../V2notes/safiearr.html">Safie arrived from
Constantinople</a> to join him. <a
href="../V2notes/condemn.html">He was tried, and condemned to
death</a>. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all
Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and
wealth, rather than the crime alleged against him, had been the
cause of his condemnation.<p>
