<h2 align=center><a
href="../V1notes/preface.html">PREFACE</a>.</h2>

T<small>HE</small> event on which this fiction is founded has
been supposed, by <a href="../V1notes/darwin.html">Dr.
Darwin</a>, and some of <a href="../V1notes/physiolo.html"> the
physiological writers of Germany</a>, as not of impossible
occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest
degree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming
it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself
as <a href="../V1notes/merely.html">merely weaving a series of
supernatural terrors</a>. The event on which the interest of the
story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of
spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the
situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a
physical fact, affords <a href="../V1notes/imagine.html">a point
of view to the imagination</a> for the delineating of human
passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the
ordinary relations of existing events can yield.<p>

I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary
principles of human nature, while <a
href="../V1notes/scrupled.html">I have not scrupled to
innovate</a> upon their combinations. The <i>Iliad</i>, the
tragic poetry of Greece, Shakespeare, in the <i>Tempest</i> and
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i> and most especially Milton, in
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, conform to this rule; and the most humble
novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from <a
href="../V1notes/hislab.html">his labours</a>, may, without
presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule,
from the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of
human feeling have resulted in the highest specimens of
poetry.<p>
