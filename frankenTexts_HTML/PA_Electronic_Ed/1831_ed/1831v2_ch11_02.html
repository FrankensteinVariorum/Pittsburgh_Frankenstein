"Soon <a href="../V2notes/agentle.html">a gentle light</a> stole over the
heavens, and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up, and beheld a
radiant form rise from among the trees.* I gazed with a kind of wonder. It
moved slowly, but it enlightened my path; and I again went out in search
of berries. I was still cold, when under one of the trees I found a huge
cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No
distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and
hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and
on all sides various scents saluted me: the only object that I could
distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with
pleasure.<p>

"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly
lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I
gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink, and
the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first
discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded
from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted
the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy,
the forms that surrounded me, and to perceive the boundaries of the
radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the
pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express
my sensations in my own mode, but the <a
href="../V2notes/uncouth.html">uncouth and inarticulate sounds</a> which
broke from me frightened me into silence again.<p>

"The moon had disappeared from the night, and <a
href="../V2notes/again.html">again, with a lessened form</a>, showed
itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had, by this
time, become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My
eyes became accustomed to the light, and to perceive objects in their
right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and, by degrees,
one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh
notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and
enticing.<p>

* The moon.<p>
