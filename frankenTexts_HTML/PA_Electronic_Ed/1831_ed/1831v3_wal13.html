His voice seemed suffocated; and <a href="../V3notes/impulses.html">my
first impulses</a>, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the
dying request of my friend, in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by
<a href="../V3notes/curiocom.html">a mixture of curiosity and
compassion</a>. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again
raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly
in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.
The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At
length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of
his passion: "Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If you had
listened to <a href="../V3notes/conscien.html">the voice of
conscience</a>, and heeded the stings of remorse, before you had urged
your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have
lived."<p>

"And do you dream?" said the d&aelig;mon; "do you think that I was then
dead to agony and remorse? -- He," he continued, pointing to the corpse,
"he suffered not in the consummation of the deed; -- oh! not the
ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering
detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while <a
href="../V3notes/poisoned.html">my heart was poisoned with remorse</a>.
Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was
fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy; and, when wrenched by
misery to vice and hatred, <a href="../V3notes/torture.html">it did not
endure the violence of the change, without torture</a> such as you cannot
even imagine.<p>
