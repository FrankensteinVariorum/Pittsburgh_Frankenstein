The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual
conversation. It was commenced partly as a source of amusement,
and partly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources
of mind. Other motives were mingled with these as the work
proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which
whatever moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters
it contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this
respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects
of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of <a
href="../V1notes/domesaff.html">the amiableness of domestic
affection</a>, and the excellence of universal virtue. The
opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation
of the hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always in
my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn from
the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of
whatever kind.</p><p>

It is a subject also of additional interest to the author that
this story was begun in the majestic region where the scene is
principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to be
regretted. I passed the <a
href="../MShelley/summer16.html">summer</a> of <a
href="../Indexes/timeline.html#1816">1816</a> in the environs of
<a href="../Places/geneva.html">Geneva</a>.  The season was cold
and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood
fire, and occasionally amused ourselves with some <a
href="../V1notes/germanst.html">German stories of ghosts</a>,
which happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us
a playful desire of imitation. <a
href="../V1notes/twoother.html">Two other friends</a> (a tale
from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the
public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself
agreed to write each a story founded on some supernatural
occurrence.</p><p>

The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends
left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent
scenes which they present, all memory of their ghostly visions.
The following tale is the only one which has been completed.</p><p>

M<small>ARLOW</small>, September, 1817.<p>
