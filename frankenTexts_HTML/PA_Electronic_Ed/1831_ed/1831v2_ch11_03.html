"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left
by some <a href="../V2notes/wanderng.html">wandering beggars</a>, and was
overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I
thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a
cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same <a
href="../V2notes/cause.html">cause should produce such opposite
effects!</a> I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it
to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches; but they were
wet, and would not burn. I was pained at this, and sat still watching the
operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat
dried, and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this; and, by touching
the various branches, I discovered the cause, and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it, and have a
plentiful supply of fire. When night came on, and brought sleep with it, I
was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it
carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches upon it; and
then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground, and sunk into sleep.</p><p>

"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I
uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I
observed this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again, I found,
with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat; and that the
discovery of this element was useful to me in my food; for I found some of
<a href="../V2notes/offals.html">the offals</a> that the travellers had
left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I
gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, <a
href="../V2notes/todress.html">to dress my food</a> in the same manner,
placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by
this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.<p>
