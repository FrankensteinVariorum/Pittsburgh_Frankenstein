It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's
house. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went
into the library  <a href="../V1notes/toattend.html">to attend</a> their usual hour of
rising.</p><p>

Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and
I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my
departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and <a
href="../V1notes/respectb.html">venerable parent!</a> He still remained to
me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father's desire,
and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, <a
href="../V1notes/kneeling.html">kneeling by the coffin</a> of her dead
father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of
dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below
this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked
upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive,
and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me:
"Welcome, my dearest Victor," said he. "Ah! I wish you had come three
months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. 
You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your
presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his
misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her
vain and tormenting self-accusations. -- Poor William! he was our darling
and our pride!"</p><p>

Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal agony
crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my
desolated home; the reality came on me as <a
href="../V1notes/disaster.html">a new, and a not less terrible,
disaster</a>. I tried to calm <a
href="../V1notes/ernest2.html">Ernest</a>; I enquired more minutely
concerning my father, and her I named cousin.</p>
