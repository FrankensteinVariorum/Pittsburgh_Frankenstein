His sentence was pronounced; and I could only grieve, and be
patient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed,
and I thought he slept;  but presently he called to me in a
feeble voice, and, bidding me come near, said -- "Alas! the
strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and
he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not,
Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel <a
href="../V3notes/burning.html">that burning hatred, and ardent
desire of revenge</a>, I once expressed; but I feel myself
justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these
last days I have been occupied in <a
href="../V3notes/examin.html">examining my past conduct</a>; nor
do I find it blameable. In <a href="../V3notes/fit.html">a fit of
enthusiastic madness</a> I created a rational creature, and was
bound towards him, to assure, as far as was in my power, his
happiness and well-being. <a href="../V3notes/duty.html">This was
my duty</a>; but there was another still paramount to that. My
duties towards the beings of my own species had <a
href="../V3notes/claims.html">greater claims to my attention</a>,
because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in
refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed
unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in evil: he destroyed my
friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite
sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this
thirst for vengeance may end. <a
href="../V3notes/miser.html">Miserable himself, that he may
render no other wretched</a>, he ought to die. The task of his
destruction was mine, but I have failed. When <a
href="../V3notes/actuated.html">actuated by selfishness and
vicious motives</a>, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work;  
and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason
and virtue.</p></p>
