"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken  
place since you left us. The blue lake, and snow-clad mountains, they  
never change; -- and I think <a href="../V1notes/placid.html">our placid 
home, and our contented hearts</a> are regulated by the same immutable laws. 
My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for 
any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you  
left us, but one change has taken place in our little household. Do  
you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?
Probably you do not; I will relate
her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a
widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had
always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange
perversity, <a href="../V1notes/hermom.html">her mother could not endure
her</a>, and, after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt
observed this; and, when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her
mother to allow her to live at our house. The <a
href="../V1notes/repub.html">republican institutions</a> of our country
have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the
<a href="../V1notes/greatmon.html">great monarchies</a> that surround it.
Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its
inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised,
their manners are more refined and moral. <a
href="../V1notes/england.html">A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in France and England</a>. Justine, thus received in
our family, learned the duties of a servant; a condition which, in our
fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice
of the dignity of a human being.<p>

"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I
recollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill humour, one glance
from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that <a
href="../V1notes/ariosto.html">Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of
Angelica</a> she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a
great attachment for her, by which <a href="../V1notes/shewas.html">she
was induced to give her an education</a> superior to that which she had at
first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most
grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any
professions, I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see by her
eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was
gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest
attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all
excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so
that <a href="../V1notes/evennow.html">even now she often reminds me of
her</a>.<p>
