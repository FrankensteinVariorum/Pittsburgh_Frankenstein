Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this
letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded to
the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my friends. I
threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.<p>

"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
weep with bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy? My dear
friend, what has happened?"<p>

I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up
and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed
from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my
misfortune.<p>

"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your
disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?"<p>

"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the
horses."<p>

During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he
could only express his heartfelt <a
href="../V1notes/sympathy.html">sympathy</a>. "Poor William!" said he,
"dear lovely child, he now <a href="../V1notes/sleeps.html">sleeps with
his angel mother</a>! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young
beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel
the murderer's grasp! How much more a murderer, that could destroy such
radiance innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his
friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his
sufferings are at an end for ever.  A sod covers his gentle form, and he
knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve
that for his miserable survivors."<p>
