<h2 >CHAPTER VI</h2>

C<small>LERVAL</small> then put the following letter into my
hands. It was from my own Elizabeth:--</p><p>

"My dearest Cousin,<p>

"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of
dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your
account. You are forbidden to write -- to hold a pen; yet one
word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our
apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post
would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my
uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented
his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
long a journey; yet how often have I regretted not being able to
perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending
on your sick bed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who
could never guess your wishes, nor minister to them with the care
and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval
writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that
you will <a href="../V1notes/youwill.html">confirm this
intelligence soon in your own handwriting</a>.</p><p>

"Get well -- and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful
home, and friends who love you dearly. <a
href="../V1notes/papheal.html">Your father's health</a> is
vigorous, and he asks but to see you, -- but to be assured that
you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent
countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement
of our <a href="../V1notes/ernest.html">Ernest</a>! He is now
sixteen, and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a
true Swiss, and to enter into foreign service; but we cannot part
with him, at least until his elder brother return to us. My uncle
is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant
country;  but Ernest never had your powers of application. He
looks upon study as an odious fetter; -- his time is spent in the
open air, climbing hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he
will become an idler, unless we yield the point, and permit him
to enter on the profession which he has selected.</p>
