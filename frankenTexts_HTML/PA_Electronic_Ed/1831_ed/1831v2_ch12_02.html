"They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went
apart, and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness; but I
was deeply affected by it. If <a href="../V2notes/suchlove.html">such
lovely creatures</a> were miserable, it was less strange that I, an <a
href="../V2notes/imperfct.html">imperfect and solitary being</a>, should
be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a
delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had
a fire to warm them when chill, and delicious viands when hungry; they
were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one
another's company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection
and kindness. <a href="../V2notes/tears.html">What did their tears
imply?</a> Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve
these questions; but perpetual attention and time explained to me many
appearances which were at first enigmatic.</p><p>

"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of
the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was <a
href="../V2notes/poverty.html">poverty</a>; and they suffered that evil in
a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the
vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow, which gave very 
little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to 
support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very 
poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers; for several times they 
placed food before the old man, when they reserved none for themselves.</p><p>

"This trait of <a href="../V2notes/kindness.html">kindness</a> moved me
sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of
their store for my own consumption; but when I found that in doing this I
inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, and satisfied myself with <a
href="../V2notes/berries.html">berries, nuts, and roots</a>, which I
gathered from a neighbouring wood.</p>
