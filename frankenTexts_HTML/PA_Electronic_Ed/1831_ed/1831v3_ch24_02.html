The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave
way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their
murderer also lived, and <a href="../V3notes/drag.html">to
destroy him I must drag out my weary existence</a>. I knelt on
the grass, and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips
exclaimed, "By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades
that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I
swear; and by thee, <a href="../V3notes/night.html">O Night, and
the spirits that preside over thee</a>, to pursue the
d√¶mon, who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in
mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life: to
execute this dear revenge, will I again behold the sun, and tread
the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and on
you, <a href="../V3notes/minister.html">wandering ministers of
vengeance</a>, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let <a
href="../V3notes/hellish.html">the cursed and hellish monster</a>
drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments
me."</p><p>

I had begun my abjuration with solemnity, and an awe which
almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard
and approved my devotion; but the furies possessed me as I
concluded, and rage choked my utterance.</p><p>

I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and
fiendish laugh. It rung on my ears long and heavily; the
mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me
with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have
been possessed by frenzy, and have destroyed my miserable
existence, but that <a href="../V3notes/myvow.html">my vow was
heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance</a>. The laughter
died away; when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close
to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper -- "I am satisfied:
<a href="../V3notes/miswret.html">miserable wretch</a>! you have
determined to live, and I am satisfied."</p>
