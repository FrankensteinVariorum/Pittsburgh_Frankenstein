<a href="../V1notes/agitate.html">These reflections have dispelled the
agitation</a> with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with
an <a href="../V1notes/enthus.html">enthusiasm</a> which elevates me to
heaven; for nothing contributes so much to tranquilise the mind as a
steady purpose, -- a point on which the soul may fix its <a
href="../V1notes/intell.html">intellectual eye</a>. This expedition has
been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the
accounts of the various voyages which have been made in <a
href="../V1notes/ocean.html">the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific
Ocean</a> through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that
a history of <a href="../V1notes/voyage.html">all the voyages made for
purposes of discovery</a> composed the whole of our good uncle Thomas's
library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of
reading. These volumes were my study <a href="../V1notes/day.html">day and
night</a>, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had
felt, as a child, on learning that my <a
href="../V1notes/injunct.html">father's dying injunction</a> had forbidden
my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.</p><p>

These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose
effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven.<a
href="../V1notes/poet.html">I also became a poet</a>, and for one year
lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might
obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are
consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I
bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of
my <a href="../V1notes/cousin.html">cousin</a>, and my thoughts were
turned into the channel of their earlier bent.<p>
