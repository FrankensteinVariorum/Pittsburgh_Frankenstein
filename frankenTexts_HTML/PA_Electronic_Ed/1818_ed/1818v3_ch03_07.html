Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had
taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of
the d√¶mon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy
despair, as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be
fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before
my eyes, and that I, for the first time, saw clearly. The idea of
renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the
threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but <a
href="../V3notes/avert.html">I did not reflect that a voluntary
act of mine could avert it</a>. I had resolved in my own mind,
that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be
an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I
banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a
different conclusion.</p><p>

Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then,
putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four
miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary: a few
boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. I
felt as if I was about <a href="../V3notes/comcrime.html">the
commission of a dreadful crime</a>, and <a
href="../V3notes/avoided.html">avoided with shuddering anxiety
any encounter</a> with my fellow-creatures. At one time the moon,
which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick
cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast
my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it
sunk, and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded;
but the air was pure, although chilled by the north-east breeze
that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with
such agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on
the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched
myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, every
thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its
keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short
time I slept soundly.<p>
