I returned home, not disappointed, for I had long considered those authors
useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I did not feel
much inclined to study the books which I had procured at his
recommendation.  M. Krempe was a little <a
href="../V1notes/squatman.html">squat man</a>, with a gruff voice and
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour of his doctrine.  Besides, I had a <a
href="../V1notes/contempt.html">contempt for the uses of modern natural
philosophy</a>. It was very different, when the masters of the science
sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand: but
now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to <a
href="../V1notes/tolimit.html">limit itself to the annihilation of those
visions</a> on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was
required to exchange <a href="../V1notes/chimeras.html">chimeras</a> of
boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.</p><p>

Such were my reflections during the first two or three days <a 
href="../V1notes/spent.html">spent 
almost in solitude</a>.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the
information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And
although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow 
deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. 
Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.<p>
