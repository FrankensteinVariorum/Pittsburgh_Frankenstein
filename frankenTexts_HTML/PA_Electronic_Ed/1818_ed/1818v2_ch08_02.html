"The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to some
degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my
conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my
conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and <a
href="../V2notes/fool.html">I was a fool</a> in having exposed my person
to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarized the old De
Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his
family, when they should have been prepared for my approach. But I did not
believe my errors to be irretrievable; and, after much consideration, I
resolved to return to the cottage, <a href="../V2notes/seek.html">seek the
old man, and by my representations win him to my party</a>.</p><p>

"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a
profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be
visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding
day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying,
and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet. I awoke
exhausted; and, finding that it was already night, I crept forth
from my hiding place, and went in search of food.</p><p>

"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the
well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at
peace. I crept into my hovel, and remained in silent expectation
of the accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour past,
the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not
appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful
misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no
motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspence.</p>
