He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with <a href="../V3notes/aneye.html">an eye so full of lofty design</a> and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved. They looked at one another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire, and consider of what had been said:  that <a href="../V3notes/north.html">I would not lead them further north</a>, if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped that, with reflection, <a href="../V3notes/courage2.html">their courage would return</a>.</p><p> 
They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in languor, and almost deprived of life.</p><p> 
How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather die, than return shamefully, -- my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and <a href="../V3notes/honour.html">honour</a>, can never willingly continue to  endure their present hardships.</p><p> 
September 7th.</p> 
<a href="../V3notes/diecast.html">The die is cast</a>; I have consented to return, if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision;  I come back <a href="../V3notes/ignorant.html">ignorant</a> and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess, to bear this <a href="../V3notes/injust.html">injustice</a> with patience.</p><p> 
<p >September 12th.</p> 
It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; -- I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and, while I am wafted towards England, and towards you, I will not despond.</p>
