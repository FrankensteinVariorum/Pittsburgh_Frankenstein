Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his
history: he asked to see them, and then himself <a 
href="../V3notes/correct.html">corrected and
augmented</a> them in many places; but principally <a 
href="../V3notes/giving.html">in giving 
the life and spirit</a> to the conversations he held with his enemy. "Since
you have preserved my narration," said he, "I would not that a
<a href="../V3notes/mutilate.html">mutilated one</a> should go down to 
posterity."<p>

Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to <a 
href="../V3notes/imagin.html">the
strangest tale that ever imagination formed</a>. My thoughts, and
every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up by the <a 
href="../V3notes/interest.html">interest for
my guest</a>, which this tale, and his own elevated and gentle
manners have created. I wish to soothe him; yet can I counsel
one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of
consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know
will be when he composes his shattered feelings to peace and
death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the <a 
href="../V3notes/offspring.html">offspring of solitude and
delirium</a>: he believes, that, when in dreams he holds converse with
his friends, and derives from that communion consolation for his
miseries, or <a href="../V3notes/excite.html">excitements to his 
vengeance</a>, that they are 
not the creations of his fancy, but the real beings who visit him from
the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to
his reveries that render them to me <a 
href="../V3notes/almostas.html">almost as 
imposing and interesting as truth</a>.<p>

Our conversations are not always confined to his own history
and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays
unbounded knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His
<a href="../V3notes/eloquenc.html">eloquence</a> is forcible and touching; 
nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or <a 
href="../V3notes/endeav.html">endeavours to move the 
passions</a> of pity or love, without tears. What <a 
href="../V3notes/glorious.html">a glorious creature</a> 
must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and
godlike in ruin. He seems to feel his own worth, and the greatness
of his fall.<p>
