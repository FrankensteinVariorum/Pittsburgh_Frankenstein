This was a <a href="../V1notes/astrange.html">strange tale</a>, but it did not <a
href="../V1notes/shakemy.html">shake my faith</a>; and I
replied earnestly, "You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.
Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent."</p><p>

At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply
impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me
cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting,
would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster,
had not Ernest exclaimed, "Good God, Papa! Victor says that he
knows who was the murderer of poor William."</p><p>

"We do also, unfortunately," replied my father; "for indeed I had rather 
have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much <a 
href="../V1notes/somuch.html">depravity and ingratitude</a> in one I valued so
highly."</p><p>

"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."</p><p>

"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She
is to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she
will be acquitted."</p><p>

This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind
that Justine, and indeed <a href="../V1notes/indeed.html">every human being</a>, was
guiltless of this
murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial
evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her;
and, in this assurance, I calmed myself, expecting the trial with
eagerness, but without prognosticating an evil result.<p>
