His voice seemed suffocated; and <a href="../V3notes/impulses.html">my first impulses</a>, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by <a href="../V3notes/curiocom.html">a mixture of curiosity and compassion</a>. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my looks upon his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him, in a pause of the tempest of his passion: "Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If you had listened to <a href="../V3notes/conscien.html">the voice of conscience</a>, and heeded the stings of remorse, before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived."</p><p> 
"And do you dream?" said the d√¶mon; "do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? -- He," he continued, pointing to the corpse, "he suffered not more in the consummation of the deed; -- oh! not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while <a href="../V3notes/poisoned.html">my heart was poisoned with remorse</a>. Think ye that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy; and, when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, <a href="../V3notes/torture.html">it did not endure the violence of the change without torture</a> such as you cannot even imagine.</p>
