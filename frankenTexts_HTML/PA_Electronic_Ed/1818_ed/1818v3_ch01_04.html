I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was
easily induced to comply; for a more indulgent and less
dictatorial parent did not exist upon earth.  Our plan was soon
arranged.  I should travel to <a
href="../V3notes/strasbrg.html">Strasburgh</a>, where Clerval would
join me.  Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland,
and our principal stay would be in England.  We should return by
France; and it was agreed that the tour should occupy the space
of two years.</p><p>

My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union
with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return to
Geneva.  "These two years," said he, "will pass swiftly, and it
will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness.
And, indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive, when we
shall all be united, and neither hopes or fears arise to disturb
<a href="../V3notes/domcalm.html">our domestic calm</a>."</p><p>

"I am content," I replied, "with your arrangement.  By that
time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we
at present are."  I sighed; but my father kindly forbore to
question me further concerning the cause of my dejection.  He
hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of travelling, would
restore my tranquillity.</p><p>

I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling
haunted me, which filled me with fear and agitation. During my
absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of
their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he
might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me
wherever I might go; and would he not accompany me to England?
This <a href="../V3notes/imagdred.html">imagination was
dreadful</a> in itself, but soothing, inasmuch
as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with the
idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen.
But through the whole period <a
href="../V3notes/slaveof.html">during which I was the slave of my
creature</a>, <a href="../V3notes/allowed.html">I allowed myself
to be governed by the impulses of the moment</a>; and my present
sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and
exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.<p>
