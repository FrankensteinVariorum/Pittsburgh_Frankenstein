In this description of <a href="../V1notes/domestic.html">our domestic
circle</a> I include Henry Clerval; for he was constantly with us.  He
went to school with me, and generally passed the afternoon at our house:
for being an only child, and destitute of companions at home, his father
was well pleased that he should find associates at our house; and we were
never completely happy when Clerval was absent.<p>

I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before
misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of <a
href="../V1notes/extensiv.html">extensive usefulness</a> into gloomy and
narrow <a href="../V1notes/reflect.html">reflections upon self</a>. But,
in drawing the picture of my early days, I must not omit to record those
events which led, by insensible steps to my after tale of misery: for when
I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which afterwards
ruled my <a href="../V1notes/destiny.html">destiny</a>, I find it arise,
like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but,
swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has
swept away all my hopes and joys.<p>

<a href="../V1notes/natural.html">Natural philosophy</a> is the genius
that has regulated my fate; I desire therefore, in this narration, to
state those facts which led to my predilection for that <a
href="../V1notes/science.html">science</a>. When I was thirteen years of
age, we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near <a
href="../Places/thonon.html">Thonon</a>: the inclemency of the weather
obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to
find a volume of the works of <a href="../People/agrippa.html">Cornelius
Agrippa</a>. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to
demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this
feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and,
bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my <a
href="../V1notes/father.html">father</a>. I cannot help remarking here the
many opportunities instructors possess of directing the attention of their
pupils to useful knowledge, which they utterly neglect.  My father looked
carelessly at the title-page of my book, and said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa!
My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash."<p>
