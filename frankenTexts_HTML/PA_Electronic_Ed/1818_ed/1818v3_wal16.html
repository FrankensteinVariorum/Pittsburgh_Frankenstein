"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the
lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they
slept, and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or
any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select
specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men,
to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin.
There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me; but your
abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on
the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which
the imagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when
they will meet my eyes, when it will haunt my thoughts, no more.</p><p>

"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.
My work is nearly complete. Neither your's nor any man's death is
needed to consummate the series of my being, and accomplish that
which must be done; but it requires my own. Do not think that I
shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel
on the ice-raft which brought me hither, and <a 
href="../V3notes/northern.html">I shall seek the 
most northern extremity of the globe</a>; I shall collect my funeral pile,
and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may
afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would
create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no
longer feel the agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of
feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me
into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of
us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or
stars, or feel the winds play on my cheeks. <a 
href="../V3notes/light.html">Light, 
feeling, and sense</a>, will pass away; and in this condition must I find my
happiness. Some years ago, when the first images which this world
affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of
summer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and the chirping of
the birds, and these were all to me, <a href="../V3notes/wept.html">I should 
have wept to die</a>; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes, and 
torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?</p>
