"'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips <a
href="../V2notes/first.html">first have I heard the voice of kindness</a>
directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present
humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point
of meeting.'<p>

"'May I know the names and residence of those friends?'<p>

"I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which
was to rob me of, or bestow happiness on me forever. I struggled
vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort
destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair, and
sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger
protectors. I had not a moment to lose; but, seizing the hand of
the old man, I cried, 'Now is the time! -- save and protect me!
You and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you
desert me in the hour of trial!'<p>

"'Great God!' exclaimed the old man, 'who are you?'<p>

"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha
entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?
Agatha fainted; and <a href="../V2notes/safcott.html">Safie, unable to
attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage</a>. Felix darted forward,
and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I
clung: <a href="../V2notes/transpor.html">in a transport of fury</a>, he
dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have
torn him limb from limb, as a lion rends the antelope. But my heart sunk
within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point
of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the
cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.</p>
