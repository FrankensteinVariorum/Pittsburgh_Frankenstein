The son confirmed his father's account: but when Daniel Nugent
was called, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his
companion, he saw a boat, <a href="../V3notes/single.html">with a
single man in it</a>, at a short distance from the shore; and, as
far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was <a
href="../V3notes/sameboat.html">the same boat</a> in which I had
just landed.</p><p>

A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was
standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of
the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of
the body, when she saw a boat, with only one man in it, push off
from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards
found.</p><p>

Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having
brought the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it
into a bed, and rubbed it; and Daniel went to the town for an
apothecary, but life was quite gone.</p><p>

Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they
agreed, that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during
the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many
hours, and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot
from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it
appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it
was likely, that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might
have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of
---- from the place where I had deposited the corpse.<p>
