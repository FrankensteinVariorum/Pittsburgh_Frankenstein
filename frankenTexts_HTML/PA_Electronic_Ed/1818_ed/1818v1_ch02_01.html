<h2 >CHAPTER II.</h2> 
W<small>HEN</small> I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I should become a student at the <a href="../V1notes/univers.html">university</a> of <a href="../Places/ingolst.html">Ingolstadt</a>. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion of my <a href="../V1notes/educat1.html">education</a>, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred -- <a href="../V1notes/anomen.html">an omen</a>, as it were, of my future misery.</p><p> 
Elizabeth had caught the <a href="../V1notes/scarlet.html">scarlet fever</a>; but her illness was not severe, and she quickly recovered.  During her confinement, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that her favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society, and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past.  The consequences of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was very malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her <a href="../V1notes/deathbed.html">death-bed</a> the fortitude and benignity of this admirable woman did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: "My children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world."</p>
