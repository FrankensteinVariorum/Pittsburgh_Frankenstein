"I agree with you," replied the stranger, "in believing that friendship is
not only a desirable, but a possible acquisition. <a
href="../V1notes/ioncehad.html">I once had a friend</a>, the most noble of
human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. 
You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But 
I -- I have lost every thing, and <a href="../V1notes/cannot.html">cannot 
begin life anew</a>."</p><p>

As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm
settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent,
and presently retired to his cabin.</p><p>

Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does
the <a href="../V1notes/beauties.html">beauties of nature</a>. The starry
sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems
still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a
double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by
disappointments; yet when he has <a href="../V1notes/hehas.html">retired
into himself</a>, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo
around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p><p>

Will you laugh at the <a href="../V1notes/enthusi.html">enthusiasm</a> I
express concerning this <a href="../V1notes/divine.html">divine
wanderer</a>? If you do, you must have certainly lost that simplicity
which was once your characteristic charm.  Yet, if you will, smile at the
warmth of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating
them.<p>
