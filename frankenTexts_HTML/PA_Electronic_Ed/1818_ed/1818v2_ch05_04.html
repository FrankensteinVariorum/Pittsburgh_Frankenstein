"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the
green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and
the eyes, <a href="../V2notes/starwood.html">stars of pale radiance among
the moonlight woods</a>; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and
balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although
they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of
the sun; for I never ventured abroad during day-light, fearful of meeting
with the same treatment as I had formerly endured in the first village
which I entered.<p>

"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master
the language; and I may boast that <a href="../V2notes/improved.html">I
improved more rapidly</a> than the Arabian, who understood very little,
and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate
almost every word that was spoken.<p>

"While I improved in speech, I also learned the <a
href="../V2notes/scilett.html">science of letters</a>, as it was taught to
the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and
delight.<p>

"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's <a
href="../V2notes/ruins.html"><i>Ruins of Empires</i></a>. I should not
have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in reading it,
given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because
the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors.
Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of
the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an
insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different
nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous
genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful
virtue of the early Romans -- of their subsequent degeneration -- of the
decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I
heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie
over <a href="../V2notes/inhabits.html">the hapless fate of its original
inhabitants</a>.<p>
