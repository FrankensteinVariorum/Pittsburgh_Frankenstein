<p align="right">August 19th, 17--.</p>

Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain
Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had
determined, once, that the memory of these evils should die with me; but
you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for <a
href="../V1notes/knowledg.html">knowledge</a> and wisdom, as I once did;
and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a 
serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation 
of my misfortunes will be useful to you, yet, if you are inclined, listen 
to my tale.  I believe that the strange incidents connected with it will 
afford a view of <a href="../V1notes/nature.html">nature</a>, which may 
enlarge your faculties and understanding.  You will hear of powers and 
occurrences, such as you have been accustomed to believe impossible: but 
I do not doubt that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the <a
href="../V1notes/mytale.html">truth</a> of the events of which it is
composed."</p><p>

You may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered
communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a
recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the
promised narrative, partly from <a
href="../V1notes/curiosit.html">curiosity</a>, and partly from a strong
desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these 
feelings in my answer.</p>
