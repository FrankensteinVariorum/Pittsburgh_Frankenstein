My <a href="../V1notes/brothers.html">brothers</a> were considerably
younger than myself; but I had a <a
href="../V1notes/friend1.html">friend</a> in one of my schoolfellows, who
compensated for this deficiency.  <a href="../V1notes/henry.html">Henry
Clerval</a> was the son of a merchant of Geneva, an <a
href="../V1notes/intimate.html">intimate friend of my father</a>.  He was
a boy of singular talent and fancy.  I remember, when he was nine years
old, he wrote a <a href="../V1notes/fairy.html">fairy tale</a>, which was
the delight and amazement of all his companions.  His favourite study
consisted in books of <a href="../V1notes/chivalry.html">chivalry and
romance</a>; and when very young, I can remember, that we used to act
plays composed by him out of these favourite books, the principal
characters of which were <a href="../V1notes/orlando.html">Orlando</a>, <a
href="../V1notes/robin.html">Robin Hood</a>, <a
href="../V1notes/amadis.html">Amadis</a>, and <a
href="../V1notes/george.html">St. George</a>.<p>

No youth could have passed more happily than mine.  My parents were
indulgent, and my companions amiable.  Our <a
href="../V1notes/studies.html">studies</a> were never forced; and by some
means we always had an end placed in view, which excited us to ardour in
the prosecution of them. It was by this method, and not by <a
href="../V1notes/notemula.html">emulation</a>, that we were urged to
application.  Elizabeth was not incited to apply herself to <a
href="../V1notes/drawing.html">drawing</a>, that her companions might not
outstrip her; but through the desire of pleasing her aunt, by the
representation of some favourite scene done by her own hand.  We learned
<a href="../V1notes/latin.html">Latin and English</a>, that we might read
the writings in those languages; and so far from study being made odious
to us through punishment, we loved application, and our amusements would
have been the labours of other children.  Perhaps we did not read so many
books, or learn languages so quickly, as those who are disciplined
according to the ordinary methods; but what we learned was impressed the
more deeply on our memories.<p>
