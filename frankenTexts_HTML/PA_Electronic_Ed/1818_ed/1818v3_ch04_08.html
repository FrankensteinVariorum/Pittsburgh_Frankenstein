I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself,
but it <a href="../V3notes/instdart.html">instantly darted into
my mind</a> that the murderer had come to mock at my misery, and
taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to
comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,
and cried out in agony--<p>

"Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God's sake, do not
let him enter!"</p><p>

Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could
not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt,
and said, in rather a severe tone--<p>

"I should have thought, <a href="../V3notes/young.html">young
man</a>, that the presence of your father would have been
welcome, instead of inspiring such violent repugnance."</p><p>

"My father!" cried I, while every feature and every muscle
was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. "Is my father, indeed, come?
How kind, how very kind. But where is he, why does he not hasten
to me?"</p><p>

My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate;
perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary
return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former
benevolence. He rose, and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a
moment my father entered it.</p><p>

Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure
than the arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him, and
cried--<p>

"<a href="../V3notes/thensafe.html">Are you then safe</a> -- and
Elizabeth -- and Ernest?"</p>
