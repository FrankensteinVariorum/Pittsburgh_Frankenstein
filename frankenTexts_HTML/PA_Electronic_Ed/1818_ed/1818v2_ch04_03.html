"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled
to assist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great
part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire; and,
during the night, I often took his tools, the use of which I
quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the
consumption of several days.<p>

"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman,
when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly
astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She
uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who
also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did
not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the
cottage, and cultivating the garden.<p>

"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these
people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings
to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke
sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and
countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a <a
href="../V2notes/godlike.html">godlike science</a>, and <a
href="../V2notes/ardently.html">I ardently desired</a> to become
acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this
purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the words they uttered, not
having any apparent connexion with visible objects, I was unable to
discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.
By great application, however, and after having remained during the space
of <a href="../V2notes/moons.html">several revolutions of the moon</a> in
my hovel, <a href="../V2notes/names.html">I discovered the names</a> that
were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned
and applied the words <i>fire</i>, <i>milk</i>, <i>bread</i>, and
<i>wood</i>. I learned also the <a href="../V2notes/cottager.html">names
of the cottagers</a> themselves. The youth and his companion had each of
them several names, but the old man had only one, which was <i>father</i>.
The girl was called <i>sister</i>, or <i>Agatha</i>; and the youth
<i>Felix</i>, <i>brother</i>, or <i>son</i>. I cannot describe the delight
I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and
was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words, without
being able as yet to <a href="../V2notes/wobeing.html">understand or apply
them</a>; such as <i>good</i>, <i>dearest</i>, <i>unhappy</i>.<p>
