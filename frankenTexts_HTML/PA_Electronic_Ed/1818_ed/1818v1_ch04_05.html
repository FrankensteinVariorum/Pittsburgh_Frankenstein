Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought
back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so
dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my
horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many
months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend therefore, in the most
cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued
talking for some time about our mutual friends, and his own good fortune
in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. "You may easily believe," said
he, "how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that it was not
absolutely necessary for a <a href="../V1notes/merchant.html">merchant</a>
not to understand any thing except book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I
left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied
entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch school-master in the <a
href="../V1notes/vicarof.html">Vicar of Wakefield</a>: 'I have ten
thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.' But
his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he
has permitted me to <a href="../V1notes/undrtake.html">undertake a voyage
of discovery to the land of knowledge</a>."</p><p>

"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how
you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth."</p><p>

"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that <a
href="../V1notes/theyhear.html">they
hear from you so seldom</a>. By the bye, I mean to lecture you a
little upon their account myself. -- But, my dear Frankenstein,"
continued he, stopping short, and gazing full in my face, "I did
not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you
look as if you had been watching for several nights."</p>
