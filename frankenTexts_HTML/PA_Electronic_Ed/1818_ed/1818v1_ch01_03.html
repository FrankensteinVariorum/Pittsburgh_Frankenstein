When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so
occupied by the duties of his new situation, that he relinquished many of
his public employments, and devoted himself to <a
href="../V1notes/theeduc.html">the education of his children</a>.  Of
these I was the eldest, and <a href="../V1notes/successr.html">the
destined successor</a> to all his labours and utility.  <a
href="../V1notes/nocreatr.html">No creature</a> could have more tender
parents than mine.  My improvement and health were their constant care,
especially as I remained for several years their only child.  But before I
continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when I
was four years of age.</p><p>

My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early
in life <a href="../V1notes/italian.html">an Italian gentleman</a>.  Soon
after her marriage, she had accompanied her husband into his native
country, and for some years my father had very little communication with
her.  About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he
received a letter from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of
marrying an Italian lady, and requesting my father to take charge of the
infant Elizabeth, the only child of his deceased sister.  "It is my wish,"
he said, "that you should consider her as your own daughter, and educate
her thus.  <a href="../V1notes/momfort.html">Her mother's fortune is
secured to her</a>, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping.
Reflect upon this proposition; and decide whether you would prefer
educating your niece yourself to her <a
href="../V1notes/stepmom.html">being brought up by a stepmother</a>."</p><p>

My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he might
accompany the little Elizabeth to her future home. I have often heard my
mother say, that she was at that time the most beautiful child she had
ever seen, and shewed signs even then of a gentle and affectionate
disposition.  These indications, and a desire to bind as closely as
possible the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to consider
Elizabeth as my future wife; <a href="../V1notes/adesign.html">a design 
which she never found reason to repent</a>.</p>
