"My uncle and I conversed a long time last night about what
profession Ernest should follow.  His constant illness when young
has deprived him of the habits of application; and now that he
enjoys good health, he is continually in the open air, climbing
the hills, or rowing on the lake.  I therefore proposed that he
should be a farmer; which you know, Cousin, is a favourite scheme
of mine.  A farmer's is a very healthy happy life; and the least
hurtful, or rather the most beneficial profession of any.  My
uncle had an idea of his being educated as an advocate, that <a
href="../V1notes/judge.html">through his interest he might become
a judge</a>.  But, besides that he is not at all fitted for such
an occupation, it is certainly <a
href="../V1notes/morecred.html">more creditable to cultivate the
earth</a> for the sustenance of man, than to be the confidant,
and sometimes the accomplice, of his vices; which is the
profession of a lawyer.  I said, that the employments of a
prosperous farmer, if they were not a more honourable, they were
at least a happier species of occupation than that of a judge,
whose misfortune it was always <a
href="../V1notes/whosemis.html">to meddle with the dark side of
human nature</a>.  My uncle smiled, and said, that I ought to be
an advocate myself, which put an end to the conversation on that
subject.</p>
