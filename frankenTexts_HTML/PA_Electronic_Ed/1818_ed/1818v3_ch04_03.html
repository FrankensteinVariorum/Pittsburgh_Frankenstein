Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be
taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it
might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon
me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I
had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I
was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other
persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange
coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night;
but, knowing that <a href="../V3notes/ihadconv.html">I had been
conversing with several persons in the island</a> I had inhabited
about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly
tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.<p>

I entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to
the coffin. How can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I
feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible
moment without shuddering and agony, that faintly reminds me of
<a href="../V3notes/anguish.html">the anguish of recognition</a>.
The trial, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed
like a dream from my memory, when I saw the lifeless form of
Henry Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath; and,
throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, "Have my murderous
machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I
have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny: but
you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor--"<p>

The human frame could no longer support the agonizing
suffering that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in
strong convulsions.<p>
