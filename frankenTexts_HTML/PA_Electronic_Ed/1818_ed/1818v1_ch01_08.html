It may appear very strange, that a <a
href="../V1notes/disciple.html">disciple of Albertus Magnus</a> should
arise in the eighteenth century; but our family was not scientifical, and
I had not attended any of the lectures given at the schools of Geneva.  My
dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the
greatest diligence into the search of the <a
href="../V1notes/philosop.html">philosopher's stone and the elixir of
life</a>. But the <a href="../V1notes/latter.html">latter</a> obtained my
undivided attention: wealth was an inferior object; but <a
href="../V1notes/whtglory.html">what glory</a> would attend the discovery,
if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man
invulnerable to any but a violent death!</p><p>

Nor were these my only visions. The <a
href="../V1notes/raising.html">raising of ghosts or devils</a> was a
promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of
which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always
unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and
mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.</p><p>

The natural ph√¶nomena that take place every day before our eyes did
not escape my examinations.  <a
href="../V1notes/distill.html">Distillation</a>, and the wonderful effects
of steam, processes of which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant,
excited my astonishment; but my utmost wonder was engaged by some <a
href="../V1notes/airpump.html">experiments on an air-pump</a>, which I saw
employed by a gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting.</p><p>

The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several
other points served to decrease their credit with me:  but I
could not entirely throw them aside, before some other system
should occupy their place in my mind.<p>
