The following day we returned to Geneva.  The intention of my
father in coming had been to divert my mind, and to restore me to
my lost tranquillity; but the medicine had been fatal.  And,
unable to account for the <a href="../V2notes/excess.html">excess
of misery</a> I appeared to suffer, he hastened to return home,
hoping the quiet and monotony of a domestic life would by degrees
alleviate my sufferings from whatsoever cause they might
spring.<p>

For myself, I was passive in all their arrangements; and the
gentle affection of my beloved Elizabeth was inadequate to draw
me from the depth of my despair.  The promise I had made to the
d&aelig;mon weighed upon my mind, like <a
href="../V2notes/dante.html">Dante's iron cowl on the heads of
the hellish hypocrites</a>.  <a
href="../V2notes/allpleas.html">All pleasures of earth and sky
passed before me</a> like a dream, and that thought only had to
me the reality of life.  Can you wonder, that sometimes <a
href="../V2notes/kindinsa.html">a kind of insanity</a> possessed
me, or that I saw continually about me a multitude of filthy
animals inflicting on me incessant torture, that often extorted
screams and bitter groans?<p>

By degrees, however, these feelings became calmed.  I entered
again into the every-day scene of life, if not with interest, at
least with some degree of tranquillity.<p>
