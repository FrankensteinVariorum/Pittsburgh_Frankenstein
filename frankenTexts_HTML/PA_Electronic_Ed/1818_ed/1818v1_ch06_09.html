It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's
house. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went
into the library  <a href="../V1notes/toattend.html">to attend</a> their usual hour of
rising.<p>

Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one
indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last
embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved
and  <a href="../V1notes/respectb.html">respectable parent!</a> He still remained to me.
I gazed on the
picture of my mother, which stood over the mantlepiece. It was
an historical subject, painted at my father's desire, and
represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair,  <a
href="../V1notes/kneeling.html">kneeling by
the coffin</a> of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek
pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly
permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a
miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.
While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive,
and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to
see me: "Welcome, my dearest Victor," said he. "Ah! I wish you
had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all
joyous and delighted.  But we are now unhappy; and, I am afraid,
tears instead of smiles will be your welcome.  Our father looks
so sorrowful:  this dreadful event seems to have revived in his
mind his grief on the death of Mamma.  Poor Elizabeth also is
quite inconsolable."  <a href="../V1notes/ernest2.html">Ernest</a> began to weep as he
said these
words.<p>

"Do not," said I, "welcome me thus; try to be more calm, that
I may not be absolutely miserable the moment I enter my father's
house after so long an absence.  But, tell me, how does my father
support his misfortunes? and how is my poor Elizabeth?"<p>
