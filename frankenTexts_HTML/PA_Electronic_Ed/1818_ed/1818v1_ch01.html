<h2 align=center><i>OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS.</i></h2>

<h2 align=center>CHAPTER I.</h2>

I <small>AM</small> <a href="../V1notes/bybirth.html">by
birth</a> a <a href="../Places/geneva.html">Genevese</a>; and my
family is one of the most distinguished of that <a
href="../V1notes/republic.html">republic</a>. My <a
href="../V1notes/ancestor.html">ancestors</a> had been for many
years counsellors and <a
href="../V1notes/syndics.html">syndics</a>; and my father had
filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He
was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and
indefatigable attention to <a
href="../V1notes/publicbs.html">public business</a>. He passed
his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his
country; and it was not until the <a
href="../V1notes/until.html">decline of life</a> that he thought
of marrying, and <a href="../V1notes/bestow.html">bestowing on
the state sons</a> who might carry his virtues and his name down
to posterity.<p>

As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I
cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate
friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell,
through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name
was <a href="../V1notes/beaufort.html">Beaufort</a>, was of a
proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
poverty and oblivion in the same <a
href="../V1notes/country.html">country</a> where he had formerly
been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his
debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated
with his daughter to the town of <a
href="../Places/lucerne.html">Lucerne</a>, where he lived unknown
and in wretchedness. <a href="../V1notes/lovedbea.html">My father
loved Beaufort</a> with the truest friendship, and was deeply
grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He
grieved also for the loss of his society, and resolved to seek
him out and endeavour to persuade him to begin the world again
through his credit and assistance.<p>
