"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape
of their victim, and spared no pains to detect and punish his
deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey
and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix, and
roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father,
and his gentle sister, lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed
the free air, and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was
torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk, that if the
latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before
Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at
a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he
hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to the vengeance of
the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.</p><p>

"He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before <a
href="../V2notes/trial.html">the trial</a> took place; the result of which
deprived them of their fortune, and condemned them to a <a
href="../V2notes/exile.html">perpetual exile</a> from their native
country.</p><p>

"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany,
where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous
Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of
oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to
poverty and impotence, became a traitor to good feeling and
honour, and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly
sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in
some plan of future maintenance.</p><p>

"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and
rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his
family. He could have endured poverty, and when this distress had
been the meed of his virtue, he would have gloried in it: but the
ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were
misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of the
Arabian now infused new life into his soul.<p>
