<h2 >VOLUME II. CHAPTER I.</h2>

N<small>OTHING</small> is more painful to the human mind, than,
after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of
events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which
follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine
died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my
veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart,
which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
like <a href="../V2notes/evilspir.html">an evil spirit</a>, for I
had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and
more, much more, <a href="../V2notes/ipersuad.html">(I persuaded
myself)</a> was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with
kindness, and the love of virtue. I had begun life with <a
href="../V2notes/beneintn.html">benevolent intentions</a>, and
thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice, and
<a href="../V2notes/makemysf.html">make myself useful</a> to my
fellow-beings. Now <a href="../V2notes/alblast.html">all was
blasted</a>: instead of that serenity of conscience, which
allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by
remorse and the <a href="../V2notes/sensgult.html">sense of
guilt</a>, which hurried me away to a <a
href="../V2notes/ahell.html">hell of intense tortures</a>, such
as <a href="../V2notes/nolang.html">no language can
describe</a>.</p><p>

This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely
recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the
face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
solitude was my only consolation -- <a
href="../V2notes/deepdark.html">deep, dark, death-like
solitude</a>.<p>

My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my
disposition and habits, and endeavoured to reason with me on the
folly of giving way to immoderate grief.  "Do you think, Victor,"
said he, "that I do not suffer also? <a
href="../V2notes/noonelov.html">No one could love a child
more</a> than I loved your brother;" (tears came into his eyes as
he spoke); "but is it not a duty to the survivors, that we should
refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of
immoderate grief? It is also <a href="../V2notes/aduty.html">a
duty</a> owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow prevents
improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of <a
href="../V2notes/dayuse.html">daily usefulness</a>, without which
no man is fit for society."</p><p>

This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case;
I should have been the first to hide my grief, and console my
friends, if remorse had not mingled its bitterness with my other
sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of
despair, and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</p>
