<p align="right"><a href="../V1notes/august13.html">August 13th</a>, 17--.</p>

My affection for my <a href="../V1notes/guest.html">guest</a> increases
every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing
degree. How can I see <a href="../V1notes/sonoble.html">so noble a
creature</a> destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?
He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he
speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow
with rapidity and <a href="../V1notes/unparal.html">unparalleled
eloquence</a>.</p><p>

He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck,
apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
unhappy, he is <a href="../V1notes/notso.html">not so utterly occupied</a>
by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the employments
of others. He has asked me many questions concerning my design; and I have
related my little history <a href="../V1notes/frank.html">frankly</a> to
him. He appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested several
alterations in my plan, which I shall find exceedingly useful. There is no
pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to spring solely from the
interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. 
He is often overcome by gloom, and then he sits by himself, and tries to
overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour.  These paroxysms
pass from him like a cloud from before the sun, though his <a
href="../V1notes/deject.html">dejection</a> never leaves him.  I have
endeavoured to win his confidence; and I trust that I have succeeded.  One
day I mentioned to him the desire I had always felt of finding <a
href="../V1notes/afriend.html">a friend who might sympathize with me</a>,
and direct me by his counsel. I said, I did not belong to that class of
men who are offended by advice. "I am <a
href="../V1notes/selfedu.html">self-educated</a>, and perhaps I hardly
rely sufficiently upon my own powers.  I wish therefore that my companion
should be wiser and more experienced than myself, to confirm and support
me; nor have I believed it impossible to find a true friend."</p>
