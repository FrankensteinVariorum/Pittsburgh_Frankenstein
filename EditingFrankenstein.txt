Editorial decisions:

1) joining words that have been hyphenated as part of the justified line breaks.

2)Use underscore (_) to denote the use of Italics or a different font face.
[Issue: how do we note the different typeface if non-Italic?]

3) We will add the TEI milestone marker for page breaks <pb n=“ “/>
Because numbering must work across three volumes and anticipate links to individual image files, the numbering scheme will use 5 digits: volume# + 0 + image #. 
Examples: 
— vol.1 image 15 as n=“10015” 
— vol.3 image 190 as n=“30190”

4) Formerly hyphenated words that cross page breaks will be joined on the previous page before the <pb> is added to the text file. Any immediate punctuation will be retained, most typically commas and periods.

5) for now each emdash is signified using two hyphens.

6) we will use the spelling as it appears rather than normalizing or modernizing the texts.

7) we will not be preserving the form work including the signatures, though we could add this into the TEI later.
