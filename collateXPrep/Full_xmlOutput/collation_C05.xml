It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.

Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.

I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p46__End"/&gt;&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p47__Start"/&gt;When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle?&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p47__End"/&gt;&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p48__Start"/&gt;His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p48__End"/&gt;&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p49__Start"/&gt;“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p49__End"/&gt;&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p50__Start"/&gt;“Yes.”&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p50__End"/&gt;&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p51__Start"/&gt;“Then I fancy we have seen him; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">for, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">for, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">for </rdg><rdg wit="#fThomas">for, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p51__End"/&gt;&lt;p loc="novel1_letter4_p52__Start"/&gt;This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued.
