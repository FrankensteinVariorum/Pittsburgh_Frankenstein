      <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by
        Dr. Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of impossible
        occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to
        such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not
        considered myself as merely <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_013" n="vi"/>weaving a series of
        supernatural terrors. The event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from
        the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the
        novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact,
        affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more
        comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can
        yield.</p>
      <p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_014" n="vii"/>principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their
        combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of <app id="var1" type="ide">

        Midsummer Night’s Dream,—and most especially Milton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule;
        and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours,
        may, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the
        adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the
        highest specimens of poetry.</p>
      <p>
                    <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_015" n="viii"/>The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested
        in casual conversation. It was <app id="var3" type="int">
                        <rdg>commenced,</rdg>
                    </app> partly as a source of amusement, and partly as an
        expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled with
        these, as the work proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever
        moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader;
        yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects
        of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_016" n="ix"/>of
        the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions
        which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be
        conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn
        from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
      <p>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story was begun in the
        majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to
          <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_017" n="x"/>be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs
        of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing
        wood fire, and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which
        happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation.
        Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the
        public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story,
        founded on some supernatural occurrence.</p>
      <p>
                    <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_018" n="xi"/>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two
        friends left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which they
        present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one which has
        been completed.</p>

        <p> St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.</p>
        <p>Y<hi rend="smallcaps">OU</hi> will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
          commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I
          arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare, and
          increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
        <p>I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of Peters<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_021" n="2"/>burgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks,
          which braces my nerves, and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This
          breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a
          foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my day dreams become
          more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost
          and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and
          delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the
          horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will
          put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing
          over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_022" n="3"/>in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
          globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the <app id="var6" type="ort">
                            <rdg>phenomena</rdg>
                        </app> of the
          heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected
          in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the
          needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require only this voyage
          to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent
          curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land
          never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are
          sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this
          laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_023" n="4"/>embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
          native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the
          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by
          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many
          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all
          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
        <p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel
          my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes so
          much to <app id="var7" type="ide">

                        </app> the mind as a steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its
          intellectual eye. This expedition has been <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_024" n="5"/>the favourite
          dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which
          have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas
          which surround the pole. You may remember, that a history of all the voyages made for
          purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle Thomas’s library. My education
          was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and
          night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on
          learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in
          a <app id="var8" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

                            </rdg>
                        </app> life.</p>
        <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions
          entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_025" n="6"/>and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I
          imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and
          <app id="var9" type="ort">
                            <rdg>Shakspeare</rdg>
                        </app> are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I
          bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and
          my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>
        <p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now,
          remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by
          inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the
          North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked
          harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my <pb xml:id="Fv1_1823_026" n="7"/>nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of
          physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical
          advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and
          acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered
          me the second dignity in the vessel, and entreated me to remain with the greatest
          earnestness; so valuable did he consider my services.</p>
        <p>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might
          have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth
          placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My
          courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_027" n="8"/>and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult
          <app id="var10" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

          raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when their’s are
          failing.</p>
        <p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the
          snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than
          that of an English stage-coach. The cold is not excessive, if you are <app id="var11" type="ide">

          deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from
          actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road
          between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.</p>

          three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying
          the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among
          those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of

        <p>Archangel, 28th March, 17—.</p>
        <p>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and <app id="var15" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

          is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my
          sailors; those whom I have already <app id="var16" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

                        </app> appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are
          certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</p>
        <p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_030" n="11"/>the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most
          severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success,
          there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will
          endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but
          that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who
          could <app id="var17" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

                        </app> with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my
          dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
          courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are
          like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of
          your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_031" n="12"/>and too
          impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated:
          for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our
          uncle Thomas’s books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets
          of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
          most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of becoming
          acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and
          am in reality more illiterate than many <app id="var18" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

                        </app> of fifteen. It is true that I have
          thought more, and that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want (as
          the painters call it) <hi rend="italic">keeping;</hi> and I greatly need a friend who
          would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_032" n="13"/>enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.</p>
        <p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean,
          nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the
          dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a
          man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of <app id="var19" type="ide">

          amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.
          He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and,
          throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that
          she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the

          to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman‘s father to consent to her
          marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in
          honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor

        <p>August 5th, 17—.</p>
        <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although
          it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your
          possession.</p>
        <p>Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on
          all sides, scarcely leaving her the <app id="var43" type="ide">
                            <rdg>
                                <seg>sea room</seg>
                            </rdg>
                        </app> in which she floated. Our situation was
          somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We
          accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_041" n="21"/>take
          place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>
        <p>About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction,
          vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades
          groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange
          sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own
          situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on
          towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man,
          but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the
          rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
          inequalities of the ice.</p>
        <p>
                        <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_042" n="23"/>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We
          were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to
          denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
          ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest
          attention.</p>
        <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice
          broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in
          the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I
          profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>
        <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the
          sailors busy on one side of <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_043" n="24"/>the vessel, apparently
          talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before,
          which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog
          remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to
          enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
          some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here
          is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”</p>
        <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.
          “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me
          whither you are bound?”</p>
        <p>You may conceive my astonishment <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_044" n="25"/>on hearing such a
          question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have
          supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for
          the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a
          voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
          Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would
          have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by
          fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry
          him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We
          accordingly brought <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_045" n="26"/>him back to the deck, and restored
          him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.
          As soon as he <app id="var44" type="ort">
                            <rdg>showed</rdg>
                        </app> signs of <app id="var45" type="int">

                        </app> we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed him near the
          chimney of the <app id="var46" type="ide">
                            <rdg>
                                <seg>kitchen-stove.</seg>
                            </rdg>
                        </app> By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which
          restored him wonderfully.</p>
        <p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared that his
          sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I
          removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never
          saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and
          even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness towards
          him, or does <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_046" n="27"/>him any the most trifling service, his
          whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that
          I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he
          gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
        <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished
          to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle
          curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire
          repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so
          strange a vehicle?</p>
        <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_047" n="28"/>replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”</p>
        <p>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Then I fancy we have seen him; <app id="var47" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

                        </app> the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs
          drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”</p>
        <p>This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning
          the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone
          with me, he <app id="var48" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

                        </app>
                    </p>
        <p>“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
          inquisitiveness of mine.”</p>
        <p>
                        <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_048" n="29"/>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
          situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”</p>
        <p>Soon after this he <app id="var50" type="int">
                            <rdg>inquired</rdg>
                        </app> if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed
          the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the
          ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of
          safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>
        <p>From this time the <app id="var51" type="ide">

          which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far
          too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. <app id="var52" type="ide">

                        <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_049" n="30"/>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange
          occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is
          very silent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his
          manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him,
          although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to
          love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and
          compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
          so attractive and amiable.</p>
        <p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide
          ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should
          have been <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_050" n="31"/>happy to have possessed as the brother of my
          heart.</p>
        <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
          incidents to record.</p>
        <anchor xml:id="C06"/>
        <p>August 13th, 17—.</p>
        <p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my
          pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by <app id="var53" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

          without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so
          cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet
          they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.</p>
        <p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently
          watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although un<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_051" n="32"/>happy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests

        <p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched

          could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt
          the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly
          from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these
          feelings in my answer.</p>
        <p>“I thank you,” he replied, “for <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_056" n="37"/>your sympathy, but it
          is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose
          in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt
          him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can
          alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
          determined.”</p>
        <p>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at
          leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I

          <p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
            relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing
            state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was
            Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
            poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
            his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable
            manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown
            and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_060" n="41"/>friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
            circumstances. He <app id="var107" type="ide">

            assistance.</p>
          <p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before
            my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,
            which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and
            despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the
            wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some
            months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
            merchant’s house. The <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_061" n="42"/>interval <app id="var111" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>was consequently</seg>

                            </app> spent
            in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for
            reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three
            months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
          <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that
            their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
            support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
            rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by
            various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>
          <p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_062" n="43"/>was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means
            of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
            her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s
            coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting
            spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his <app id="var112" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            his <app id="var113" type="int">

                            </app> he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a
            relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.</p>
          <p>
                            <anchor id="struct12a" subtype="ide"/>When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so occupied by the
            duties of his new situation, that he relinquished many of his public employments, and
            devoted himself to the education of his children. Of these I was the eldest, and the
            destined suc<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_063" n="44"/>cessor to all his labours and utility. No
            creature could have more tender parents than mine. My improvement and health were their
            constant care, especially as I remained for several years their only child. But before I
            continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when I was four years
            of age.</p>
          <p>My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early in life an
            Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage, she had accompanied her husband into his
            native country, and for some years my father had very little communication with her.
            About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter
            from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an Italian lady, and
            requesting my father to take charge of the in<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_064" n="45"/>fant
            Elizabeth, the only child of his deceased sister. “It is my wish,” he said, "that you
            should consider her as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her <app id="var1345" type="ort">
                                <rdg>mother's</rdg>
                            </app> fortune is
            secured to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping. Reflect upon this
            proposition; and decide whether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her
            being brought up by a stepmother.”</p>
          <p>My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he might accompany the
            little Elizabeth to her future home. I have often heard my mother say, that she was at
            that time the most beautiful child she had ever seen, and <app id="var1346" type="ort">
                                <rdg>showed</rdg>
                            </app> signs even then of a
            gentle and affectionate disposition. These indications, and a desire to bind as closely
            as possible the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to consider Elizabeth <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_065" n="46"/>as my future wife; a design which she never found reason
            to repent.</p>
          <p>From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my
            friend. She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect.
            Although she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her
            disposition uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could
            submit with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was
            luxuriant, yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her
            mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness.
            Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she
            appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired her under<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_066" n="47"/>standing and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should
            on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to
            so little pretension.</p>
          <p>Every one adored Elizabeth. If the servants had any request to make, it was always

            although there was a great dissimilitude in our characters, there was an harmony in that
            very dissimilitude. I was more calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my temper
            was not so yielding. My application was of longer endurance; but it was not so severe
            whilst it endured. I delighted in investigating the facts relative to the actual world;
            she busied herself in following the aërial creations of the poets. The world was to me a
            secret, which I desired to dis<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_067" n="48"/>cover; to her it was a

            parents were indulgent, and my companions amiable. Our studies were never forced; and by
            some means we always had an end placed in view, which excited us to ardour in the
            prosecution of them. It was by this method, and not by emulation, that we were urged to
            application. Elizabeth was not incited to apply herself to drawing, that her companions
            might not outstrip her; but through the desire of pleasing her aunt, by the
            representation of some favourite scene done by her own hand. We learned Latin and
            English, that we might read the writings in those languages; and so far from study being
            made odious to us through punishment, we loved application, and our amusements would
            have been the labours of other children. Perhaps we did not read so many books, or learn
            languages so quickly, as those <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_069" n="50"/>who are disciplined

            from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the
            torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.</p>

            I was thirteen years of age, we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near
            Thonon: the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In
            this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
            with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_071" n="52"/>wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this
            feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with
            joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. <app id="var128" type="ide">

            this; it is sad trash.”</p>
          <p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the
            principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of science
            had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the
            powers of the latter were chimerical, while those <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_072" n="53"/>of
            the former were real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have

          <p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally

            was <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_075" n="56"/>engaged by some experiments on an <app id="var1350" type="ort">

                            </app> which I
            saw employed by a gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting.</p>
          <p>The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several other points served to
            decrease their credit with me: but I could not entirely throw them aside, before some

                            </app> we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we
            witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It advanced from behind the
            mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various
            quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with
            curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_076" n="57"/>fire issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood
            about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak
            had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next
            morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the
            shock, but entirely reduced to thin <app id="var154" type="ort">

          <p>
                            <anchor id="struct20a" subtype="ide"/>The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I eagerly inquired of
            my father the nature and origin of thunder and lightning. He replied, “Electricity;”
            describing at the same time the various effects of that power. He constructed a small
            electrical machine, and exhibited a few experiments; he made also a kite, with a wire
            and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds. </p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_077" n="58"/>This last stroke completed the overthrow of Cornelius
            Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, who had so long reigned the lords of my
            imagination. But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to commence the study of any
            modern system; and this disinclination was influenced by the following circumstance.</p>
          <p>My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures upon natural
            philosophy, to which I cheerfully consented. Some accident prevented my attending these
            lectures until the course was nearly finished. The <app id="var1351" type="int">
                                <rdg>lecture being, therefore,</rdg>
                            </app> one of the
            last, was entirely incomprehensible to me. The professor discoursed with the greatest
            fluency of potassium and boron, of sulphates and oxyds, terms to which I could affix no
            idea; and I became disgusted with the science of natural philosophy, although I still
            read <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_078" n="59"/>Pliny and Buffon with delight, authors, in my
            estimation, of nearly equal interest and utility.</p>
          <p>My occupations at this age were principally the mathematics, and most of the branches
            of study appertaining to that science. I was busily employed in learning languages;
            Latin was already familiar to me, and I began to read some of the easiest Greek authors
            without the help of a lexicon. I also perfectly understood English and German. This is
            the list of my accomplishments at the age of seventeen; and you may conceive that my
            hours were fully employed in acquiring and maintaining a knowledge of this various
            literature.</p>
          <p>Another task also devolved upon me, when I became the instructor of my brothers. Ernest
            was six years younger than myself, and was my principal pupil. He had been afflicted
            with ill health <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_079" n="60"/>from his infancy, through which
            Elizabeth and I had been his constant <app id="var1352" type="int">
                                <rdg>nurses;</rdg>
                            </app> his disposition was gentle, but he was
            incapable of any severe application. William, the youngest of our family, was yet an
            infant, and the most beautiful little fellow in the world; his lively blue eyes, dimpled
            cheeks, and endearing manners, inspired the tenderest affection.</p>
          <p>Such was our domestic circle, from which care and pain seemed for ever banished. My
            father directed our studies, and my mother partook of our enjoyments. Neither of us
            possessed the slightest pre-eminence over the other; the voice of command was never
            heard amongst us; but mutual affection engaged us all to comply with and obey the
            slightest desire of each other. <anchor id="struct20b" subtype="ide"/>

            that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended

            education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native
            country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved

            our own, can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
            extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be hushed,
            never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse
            of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.
            Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear <app id="var173" type="ide">

            although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had
            still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest, and

            gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure,
            and partly because she reflected that the same journey was to have taken place three
            months before, when a mother’s blessing would have accompanied me.<anchor id="struct23b" subtype="ide"/>

          <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the most
            melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions,
            continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I was now alone. In <app id="var195" type="sub">

            hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me invincible
            repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_087" n="68"/>these were “old familiar faces;” but I believed myself
            totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced
            my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the
            acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my
            youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my station
            among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have
            been folly to repent.</p>
          <p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to
            Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town
            met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend the
            evening as I pleased. </p>

                            </app> Besides, I had a
            contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when the
            masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were
            grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the <app id="var214" type="ide">

            founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of
            little worth.</p>
          <p>Such were my reflections during the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_091" n="72"/>first two or
            three days <app id="var215" type="ide">

            information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could
            not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a
            pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had
            hitherto been out of town.</p>
          <p>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
            M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
            appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
            benevolence; a few <app id="var217" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
            were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_092" n="73"/>voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his
            lecture by a recapitulation of the history of <app id="var218" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most
            distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the
            science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory
            experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
            shall never forget:—</p>
          <p>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and
            performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
            be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
            hands seem only made to dabble in <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_093" n="74"/>dirt, and their eyes

            had exhibited. He said, that “these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern
            philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left
            to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications,
            the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.
            The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in
            ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened to his statement,
            which was delivered without any presumption or affectation; and then added, that his
            lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; <app id="var228" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            procure.</p>
          <p>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application
            equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
            natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be <app id="var229" type="int">

                            </app> it is
            on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
            neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry <app id="var230" type="int">

            attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a
            man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to
            every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”</p>
          <p>He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_096" n="77"/>various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to
            procure, and promising me the use of his <app id="var231" type="int">

          <p>From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive
            sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those works, so
            full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these
            subjects. I attended the lectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of
            science of the university; and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and
            real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but
            not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_098" n="79"/>a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and his
            instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature, that banished every

                            </app> that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with
            a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most
            heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I
            paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some
            discoveries, which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can
            conceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as others have
            gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is
            continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity, which closely
            pursues one study, must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
              con<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_100" n="81"/>tinually sought the attainment of one object of
            pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this, improved so rapidly, that, at the end of two
            years, I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which
            procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this
            point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural
            philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my
            residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to
            my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.</p>
          <p>One of the <app id="var243" type="ort">
                                <rdg>phenomena</rdg>
                            </app> which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of
            the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself,
            did the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_101" n="82"/>principle of life proceed? It was a bold
            question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things
            are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not
            restrain our <app id="var244" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>inquiries.</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined
            thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy
            which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural
            enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost
            intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I
            became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also
            observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father
            had taken the greatest precautions that my mind <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_102" n="83"/>should
            be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a
            tale of superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no
            effect upon my fancy; and a <app id="var245" type="ort">
                                <rdg>churchyard</rdg>
                            </app> was to me merely the receptacle of bodies
            deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for
            the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to
            spend days and nights in vaults and <app id="var246" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>charnel-houses.</rdg>
                            </app> My attention was fixed upon every
            object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine
            form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the
            blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I
            paused, examining and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_103" n="84"/>analysing all the minutiæ of
            causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until
            from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and
            wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect
            which it illustrated, I was <app id="var247" type="int">
                                <rdg>surprised,</rdg>

                            </app> towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so
            astonishing a secret.</p>
          <p>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly
            shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have
            produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and
            nights of incredible labour and fatigue, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_104" n="85"/>I succeeded
            in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of
            bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.</p>
          <p>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to
            delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at
            the summit of my desires, was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this
            discovery was so great and overwhelming, that all the steps by which I had been
            progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been
            the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the <app id="var250" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> was now within
            my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I
            had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_105" n="86"/>so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search, than to
            exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried
            with the dead, and found a passage to <app id="var251" type="int">
                                <rdg>life,</rdg>
                            </app> aided only by one glimmering, and seemingly
            ineffectual, light.</p>
          <p>I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend,
            that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be:
            listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am
            reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
            to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at
            least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier
            that <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_106" n="87"/>man is who believes his native town to be the
            world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.</p>
          <p>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time
            concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of
            bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its
            intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
            difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a
            being like <app id="var252" type="int">
                                <rdg>myself,</rdg>
                            </app> or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much
            exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an
            animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command
            hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an un<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_107" n="88"/>dertaking;
            but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of
            reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect:
            yet, when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and
            mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the
            foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my
            plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began
            the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great <app id="var253" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>hindrance</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app>
            to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic
            stature; that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After
            having formed this determination, and having spent <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_108" n="89"/>some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.</p>
          <p>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in
            the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I
            should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new
            species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
            owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as
            I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought, that if I could bestow
            animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it
            impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.</p>
          <p>These thoughts supported my spirits, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_109" n="90"/>while I pursued
            my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
            person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty,
            I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might
            <app id="var254" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated
            myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
            eagerness, I pursued nature to her <app id="var255" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>hiding-places.</rdg>
                            </app> Who shall conceive the horrors of my
            secret toil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the
            living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with
            the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost <app id="var256" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            seemed to <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_110" n="91"/>have lost all soul or sensation but for this
            one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
            acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my
            old habits. I collected bones from <app id="var257" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>charnel-houses;</rdg>
                            </app> and disturbed, with profane fingers,
            the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the
            top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and
            staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy <app id="var258" type="int">
                                <rdg>creation:</rdg>
                            </app> my <app id="var259" type="ide">

                            </app> were starting from their
            sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the
            slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with
            loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually
            increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_111" n="92"/>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged,
            heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
            bestow a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my
            eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me
            neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many
            miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted
            them; and I well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are pleased
            with yourself, you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from
            you. You must pardon <app id="var260" type="int">
                                <rdg>me</rdg>
                            </app> if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof
            that your other duties are equally neglected.”</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_112" n="93"/>I knew well therefore what would be my father’s
            feelings; but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but
            which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to
            procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which
            swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.</p>
          <p>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice, or
            faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I
            should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to
            preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
            disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception
            to this rule. If the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_113" n="94"/>study to which you apply yourself
            has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple
            pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful,
            that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no
            man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
            affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Cæsar would have spared his country; America
            would have been discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not
            been destroyed.</p>
          <p>But I forget that I am <app id="var261" type="ide">

          <p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the
            accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
            the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the
            lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered
            dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of
            the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_117" n="98"/>hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its
            limbs.</p>
          <p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
            with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in
            proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His
            yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a
            lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only
            formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same
            colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled <app id="var274" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            straight black lips.</p>
          <p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.
            I had worked hard for <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_118" n="99"/>nearly two years, for the sole
            purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest
            and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I
            had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled
            my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the
            room, and continued a long time traversing my <app id="var275" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>bed-chamber,</seg>

                            </app> unable to compose my mind to
            sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I threw
            myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
            But it was in vain: I <app id="var276" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought
            I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted
            and surprised, I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_119" n="100"/>embraced her; but as I imprinted the
            first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared
            to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud
            enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I
            started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered,
            and every limb became <app id="var277" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>convulsed;</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it
            forced its way through the <app id="var278" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>window shutters,</rdg>
                            </app> I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster
            whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be
            called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds,
            while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was
            stretched <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_120" n="101"/>out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped,
            and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard belonging to the house which I
            inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the
            greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were
            to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given
            life.</p>
          <p>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with
            animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished;
            he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it
            became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>
          <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_121" n="102"/>hardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at
            others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with
            this horror, I felt the bitterness of <app id="var279" type="int">
                                <rdg>disappointment;</rdg>
                            </app> dreams that had been my food and

            rapid, the overthrow so complete!</p>
          <p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching
            eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth
            hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and
            I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
            wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not
            dare return to the apartment which <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_122" n="103"/>I inhabited, but
            felt impelled to hurry on, although <app id="var281" type="ide">

          <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to
            ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets, without any clear
            conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of
            fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about <app id="var283" type="ide">

          <p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_123" n="104"/>diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I
            paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that
            was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer, I observed
            that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just where I was standing; and, on the door
            being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My
            dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you! how fortunate that you
            should be here at the very moment of my alighting!”</p>
          <p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my
            thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.
            I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly,
            and for the first time during many months, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_124" n="105"/>calm and
            serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked
            towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends,
            and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily
            believe,” said he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that <app id="var288" type="ide">

          <p>“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By

            watching for several nights.”</p>

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_126" n="107"/>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think

            quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me
            shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive,
            and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry
            should see him. Entreating <app id="var293" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door
            before I recollected myself. I then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw
            the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to
            stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_127" n="108"/>appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room
            was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a
            <app id="var294" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            fled, I clapped my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.</p>
          <p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable
            to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with
            excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single
            instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed
            aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival; but when he
            observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_128" n="109"/>my
            eyes for which he could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter,
            frightened and astonished him.</p>
          <p>“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that
            manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?</p>
          <p>“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the
            dreaded spectre glide into the room; “<hi rend="italic">he</hi> can tell.—Oh, save me!
            save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously, and fell down in
            a fit.</p>
          <p>Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with
            such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of his grief; for
            I was lifeless, and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_129" n="110"/>This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which
            confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I
            afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age, and unfitness for so long a
            journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by
            concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and
            attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not
            doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards
            them.</p>
          <p>But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting
            attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom
            I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_130" n="111"/>and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry: he at
            first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the
            pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same <app id="var295" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>subject</seg>

                            </app> persuaded him that my
            disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</p>
          <p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and grieved my friend, I
            recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with
            any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared, and that the
            young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine
            spring; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments
            of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_131" n="112"/>gloom
            disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the
            fatal passion.</p>
          <p>“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole
            winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in
            my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the
            disappointment of which I have been the occasion; but you will forgive me.”</p>
          <p>“You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as
            you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject,
            may I not?”</p>
          <p>I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared
            not even think?</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_132" n="113"/>“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my
            change of colour, “I will not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin
            would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own hand-writing. They
            hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at your long silence.”</p>
          <p>“Is that <app id="var296" type="ide">

          <p>“I cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning your health. We
            cannot help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals the extent of your disorder: for
            it is now several months since we have seen your hand-writing; and all this time you
            have been obliged to dictate your letters to Henry. Surely, Victor, you must have <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_134" n="115"/>been exceedingly ill; and this makes us all very
            wretched, as much so nearly as after the death of your dear mother. My uncle was almost
            persuaded that you were indeed dangerously ill, and could hardly be restrained from
            undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. Clerval always writes that you are getting better;
            I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own <app id="var1353" type="ort">
                                <rdg>handwriting;</rdg>
                            </app> for
            indeed, indeed, Victor, we are all very miserable on this account. Relieve us from this
            fear, and we shall be the happiest creatures in the world. Your father’s health is now
            so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since last winter. Ernest also is so much
            improved, that you would hardly know him: he is now nearly sixteen, and has lost that
            sickly appearance which he had some years ago; he is grown quite robust and active.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_135" n="116"/>“My uncle and I conversed a long time last night
            about what profession Ernest should follow. His constant illness when young has deprived
            him of the habits of application; and now that he enjoys good health, he is continually
            in the open air, climbing the hills, or rowing on the lake. I therefore proposed that he
            should be a farmer; which you know, <app id="var1354" type="ort">
                                <rdg>cousin,</rdg>
                            </app> is a favourite scheme of mine. A farmer’s is
            a very healthy happy life; and the least hurtful, or rather the most beneficial
            profession of any. My uncle had an idea of his being educated as an advocate, that
            through his interest he might become a judge. But, besides that he is not at all fitted
            for such an occupation, it is certainly more creditable to cultivate the earth for the
            sustenance of man, than to be the confidant, and sometimes the accomplice, of his vices;
            which is <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_136" n="117"/>the profession of a lawyer. I said, that the
            employments of a prosperous farmer, if they were not a more honourable, they were at
            least a happier species of occupation than that of a judge, whose misfortune it was
            always to meddle with the dark side of human nature. My uncle smiled, and said, that I
            ought to be an advocate myself, which put an end to the conversation on that
            subject.<anchor id="struct26b" subtype="ide"/>

            simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that
            surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its
            inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners
            are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a
            servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties
            of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of
            ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. </p>

            Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty
            of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment
            for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she
            had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful
            little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any <app id="var307" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            one pass her lips; but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
            Although her disposition was gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_139" n="120"/>greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She
            thought her the model of all excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and
            manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.</p>
          <p>“When my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their own grief to
            notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious
            affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.</p>
          <p>“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her
            neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she
            began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise
            her partiality. She was a Roman <app id="var308" type="ide">

            months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant
            mother. Poor girl! she wept when she quitted our <app id="var309" type="int">

                            </app> she was much altered since the
            death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which
            had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of
            a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
            She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of
            having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw
            Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now
            at peace <app id="var310" type="ide">

            to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and
            extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions continually remind
            me of my dear aunt.</p>
          <p>“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish
            you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark
            eye-lashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek,
            which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little <hi rend="italic">wives</hi>, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of
            age.</p>
          <p>“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the
            good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_142" n="123"/>received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young
            Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich
            banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several
            misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his
            spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively pretty
            Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is
            very much admired, and a favourite with <app id="var311" type="ide">

            instantly, and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion
            greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In
            another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>
          <p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several
            professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill
            befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_144" n="125"/>night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my
            misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.
            When I was otherwise quite restored to <app id="var318" type="int">
                                <rdg>health</rdg>
                            </app> the sight of a chemical instrument would
            renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my
            apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had
            acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares
            of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted
            torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made
            in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; <app id="var319" type="int">
                                <rdg>but</rdg>
                            </app> not guessing the
            real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my <app id="var320" type="int">

                            </app> to the science itself, with a desire, as I
            evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented
            me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
            were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his
            words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were
            always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in
            excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my
            friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he
            never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of
            affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_146" n="127"/>myself to confide to him that event which was so often
            present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress
            more deeply.</p>
          <p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost
            insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the
            benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I
            assure you he has outstript us all. <app id="var321" type="ort">

            the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.

            unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with
            any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the
            spring was uncommonly late, when it <app id="var341" type="int">

          <p>The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to
            fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of

            I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had
            always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among
            the scenes of my native country.</p>

            health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
            salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation
            of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures,
            and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he
            again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.

            on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
            ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the
            hedges, while those of summer were already in <app id="var346" type="ide">

            himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The
            resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full
            of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he
            invented tales of wonderful fancy and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_152" n="133"/>passion. At
            other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he
            supported with great ingenuity.</p>
          <p>We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every
            one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with
            feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.</p>

          <p>“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”</p>
          <p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
            the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my
            friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.</p>
          <p>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
            “are you always to be <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_159" n="140"/>unhappy? My dear friend, what
            has happened?”</p>
          <p>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the
            extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account
            of my misfortune.</p>
          <p>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.
            What do you intend to do?”</p>
          <p>“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”</p>
          <p>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to <app id="var365" type="ide">

          <p>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on
            my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses
            arrived, I hurried into a <app id="var372" type="ide">

          <p>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console
            and <app id="var373" type="ide">

            but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the
            multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my
            youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be
            during that <app id="var374" type="int">
                                <rdg>time!</rdg>
                            </app> One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand
            little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although
            they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I
            dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I
            was unable to define them.</p>
          <p>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the
            lake: the waters were placid; all around was <app id="var375" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards
            Geneva.</p>
          <p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native
            town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of
            Mont <app id="var376" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is
            this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”</p>
          <p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary
            circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with
            pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a na<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_163" n="144"/>tive can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and,

                        </p>
          <p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around;
            and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture
            appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to
            become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in
            one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
            conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.</p>
          <p>It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town
            were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_164" n="145"/>Secheron, a village <app id="var379" type="ide">

            serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William
            had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake
            in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings
            playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to
            approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its
            progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly
            in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.</p>
          <p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every
            minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from
            Salêve, the Juras, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_165" n="146"/>and the Alps of Savoy; vivid
            flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a
            vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until
            the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
            Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm
            hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
            promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
            faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain
            to the east of the lake.</p>
          <p>While I watched the <app id="var382" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.
            This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud,
            “William, dear <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_166" n="147"/>angel! this is thy funeral, this thy
            dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind
            a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A
            flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
            gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to
            humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy <app id="var383" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> to whom I had
            given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer
            of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of
            its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The
            figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_167" n="148"/>shape could have destroyed that fair child. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the
            idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it
            would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks
            of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
            south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>
          <p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene
            was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had
            until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress towards the creation; the
            appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my <app id="var384" type="ide">

            had <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_168" n="149"/>now nearly elapsed since the night on which he
            first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the
            world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my
            brother?</p>
          <p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I
            spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the
            weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being
            whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of
            horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
            my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to
            me.</p>
          <p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_169" n="150"/>towards the
            town. The gates were <app id="var385" type="int">
                                <rdg>open,</rdg>
                            </app> and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to
            discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused
            when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and
            endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible
            mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the
            time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale
            otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a
            relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the
            strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as
            to persuade <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_170" n="151"/>my relatives to commence it. <app id="var386" type="ide">

            remain silent.</p>
          <p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants
            not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of
            rising.</p>
          <p>Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in

            an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and
            her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
            sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed
            when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive,
            and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: “Welcome, my
            dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would
            have found us all joyous and delighted. <app id="var390" type="ide">

          <p>He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_174" n="155"/>discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to

                            </app> one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel
            she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my
            mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant
            instantly <app id="var404" type="ort">
                                <rdg>showed</rdg>

            family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On
            being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by
            her extreme confusion of manner.</p>
          <p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You
            are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_175" n="156"/>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness
            deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
            after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic
            than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, <app id="var405" type="ort">
                                <rdg>papa!</rdg>
                            </app> Victor says that
            he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”</p>
          <p>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather have been for
            ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so
            highly.”</p>
          <p>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”</p>
          <p>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried to-day, and
            I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.” </p>

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_176" n="157"/>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my
            own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had
            no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong
            enough to convict <app id="var406" type="ide">

            every aggravation of infamy that could make <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_180" n="161"/>the
            murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities
            which promised to render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious
            grave; and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of
            the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and such a
            declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman, and would not have
            exculpated her who suffered through me.</p>
          <p>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
            always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
            Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and
            execrated by thousands; for all the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_181" n="161"/>kindness which
            her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators
            by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil,
            yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been
            adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
            When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we
            were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered
            herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.</p>
          <p>The trial began; <app id="var421" type="int">
                                <rdg>and,</rdg>
                            </app> after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several
            witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_182" n="163"/>which might have staggered any one who had not such
            proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the
            murder had been committed, and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not
            far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The
            woman asked her what she did there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned a
            confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o’clock; <app id="var422" type="int">
                                <rdg>and,</rdg>

                            </app> that she had been looking
            for the child, and demanded <app id="var425" type="int">

                            </app> if any thing had been heard concerning him. When

                            </app> the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days. The
            picture was then produced, which the servant had found in her <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_183" n="164"/>pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
            which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur
            of horror and indignation filled the court.</p>
          <p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had
            altered. Surprise, horror, and <app id="var427" type="int">
                                <rdg>misery</rdg>
                            </app> were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled
            with her tears; <app id="var428" type="int">
                                <rdg>but,</rdg>
                            </app> when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers, and <app id="var429" type="ide">

                        </p>
          <p>“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my
            protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of
            the facts which have been adduced against me; and I hope the character I have always
            borne will incline my judges <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_184" n="165"/>to a favourable
            interpretation, where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.”</p>
          <p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of
            the night on which the murder had been <app id="var432" type="int">
                                <rdg>committed</rdg>
                            </app> at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a
            village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock,
            she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She
            was alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates
            of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn
            belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
            known. <app id="var433" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                                    <seg>asylum early,</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> that she might again
            endeavour to find my <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_185" n="166"/>brother. If she had gone near
            the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered
            when questioned by the <app id="var435" type="int">
                                <rdg>market-woman</rdg>
                            </app> was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless
            night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could
            give no account.</p>
          <p>“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance
            weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my
            utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it
            might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have
            no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.
            Did the murderer place it there? I know of <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_186" n="167"/>no
            opportunity afforded him for so doing; <app id="var436" type="int">
                                <rdg>or,</rdg>
                            </app> if I had, why should he have stolen the
            jewel, to part with it again so soon?</p>
          <p>“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg
            permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character; and if their
            testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would
            pledge my salvation on my innocence.”</p>
          <p>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of
            her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them
            timorous, and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her
            excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when,
            although violently agi<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_187" n="168"/>tated, she desired permission
            to address the court.</p>
          <p>“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his
            sister, for I was educated <app id="var437" type="int">
                                <rdg>by,</rdg>
                            </app> and have lived with his parents ever since and even long

            occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
            pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her
            character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with
            her, at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years. During all that period
            she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame
            Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last <app id="var439" type="int">
                                <rdg>illness,</rdg>
                            </app> with the greatest affection and care; and
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_188" n="169"/>afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious
            illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew <app id="var440" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>her. After</seg>

                            </app> which she
            again lived in my uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly
            attached to the child who is now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate
            mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the
            evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no
            temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she
            had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem
            and value her.”</p>

            generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_189" n="170"/>public indignation was turned with renewed violence,
            charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she
            did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I
            believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon, who had (I did not for a minute
            doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to
            death and <app id="var443" type="ide">

                            </app> I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I perceived
            that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already condemned my
            unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not
            equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and
            would not forego their hold.</p>
          <p>I passed a night of unmingled wretch<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_190" n="171"/>edness. In the
            morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
            question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots
            had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.</p>
          <p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of
            horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words
            cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to
            whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That
            evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it;
            and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence,
            be it ever so decisive.”</p>

          <p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s

          <p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a <app id="var450" type="ide">

            seeing us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of
            Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Justine!” said she, why did you rob me of my last <app id="var452" type="ide">

                            </app> Her voice was
            suffocated with sobs.</p>
          <p>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not
            one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I
            heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
            assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but
            your own confession.”</p>
          <p>“I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but
            now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven
            forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and
            menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_194" n="175"/>said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire
            in my last moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all
            looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil
            hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.”</p>
          <p>She paused, weeping, and then continued—“I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you
            should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you
            loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have
            perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven,
            where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and

          <p>“I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and poignant to admit
            of consolation, for there is no hope. Yet heaven bless thee, my dearest Justine, with
            resignation, and a confidence elevated beyond this world. Oh! how I hate its <app id="var1357" type="ort">

            is immediately deprived of life in a slow torturing manner; then the executioners, their
            hands yet reeking with the blood of innocence, believe that they have done a great deed.
            They call this <hi rend="italic">retribution</hi>. Hateful name! When that word is
            pronounced, I know greater and more horrid punishments are going to be inflicted than
            the gloomiest tyrant has ever invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this is not
            consolation for you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in escaping from so
            miserable a den. Alas! I would I were in peace with my aunt and my lovely William,
            escaped from a world which is hateful to me, and the visages of men which I abhor.”</p>
          <p>Justine smiled languidly. “This, dear lady, is despair, and not resign<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_197" n="178"/>ation. I must not learn the lesson that you would teach
            me. Talk of something else, something that will bring peace, and not increase of
            misery.”<anchor id="struct30b" subtype="ide"/>

          <p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could
            conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor
            victim, who on the morrow was to pass the <app id="var461" type="ide">

            not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together,
            uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it
            was, she approached me, and said, “Dear <app id="var462" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                                </rdg>
                            </app>
                        </p>
          <p>I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_198" n="179"/>of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard
            that you had confessed, he did not credit it.”</p>
          <p>“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those
            who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as
            I am! It removes more than half my misfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace,
            now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”</p>
          <p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the
            resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my
            bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy;
            but her’s also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the
            fair moon, for a while <app id="var464" type="ide">

            was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried she,
            “that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.”</p>
          <p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter
            tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed emotion,
            “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may <app id="var466" type="ide">

                            <anchor id="struct32a" subtype="ide"/>As we returned, Elizabeth said, “You know not, my dear Victor, how much I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_200" n="181"/>am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this
            unfortunate girl. I never could again have known peace, if I had been deceived in my
            reliance on her. For the moment that I did believe her guilty, I felt an anguish that I
            could not have long sustained. Now my heart is lightened. The innocent suffers; but she
            whom I thought amiable and good has not betrayed the trust I reposed in her, and I am

            Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a
            weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep
            fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_202" n="183"/>beyond description horrible, and more, much <app id="var470" type="ide">

            of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment when
            I should put them in practice, and make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now all was
            blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the
            past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was
            seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense
            tortures, such as no language can describe.</p>
          <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had <app id="var472" type="ide">

          <p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the

            remorse had not mingled its <app id="var479" type="ide">

          <p>About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was particularly
            agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o’clock, and the
            impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour, had rendered our residence
            within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of
            the family had retired for the night, I took the boat, and passed many hours upon the
            water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after
            rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course, and gave
            way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_205" n="186"/>all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered
            restless in a scene so beautiful and <app id="var480" type="ide">

            I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my
            calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering
            Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought
            also of my father, and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave them
            exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</p>
          <p>At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that
            I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_206" n="187"/>could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of
            unalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should
            perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that
            he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the
            recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved
            remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him,
            I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that
            life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice,
            my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to
            the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_207" n="188"/>there,
            have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the

          <p>Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply shaken by the horror
            of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in
            her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal
            woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so
            blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_208" n="189"/>“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the
            miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they
            before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice, that I
            read in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils; at
            least they were remote, and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now
            misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood.
            Yet I am certainly unjust. Every body believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she
            could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the
            most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son
            of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared
            to love as <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_209" n="190"/>if it had been her own! I could not
            consent to the death of any human being; but certainly I should have thought such a
            creature unfit to remain in the society of men. <app id="var486" type="ide">

                            </app> she was innocent. I know, I feel she
            was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when
            falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I
            feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are
            crowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were
            assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps
            respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I
            would not change places with such a wretch.”</p>
          <p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_210" n="191"/>in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my
            anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my <app id="var487" type="int">

            same time she smiled, that she might chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart. My
            father, who saw in the unhappiness that was painted in my face only an exaggeration of
            that <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_211" n="192"/>sorrow which I might naturally feel, thought
            that an amusement suited to my taste would be the best means of restoring to me my
            wonted serenity. It was from this cause that he had removed to the country; and, induced
            by the same motive, he now proposed that we should all make an excursion to the valley
            of Chamounix. I had been there before, but Elizabeth and Ernest never had; and both had
            often expressed an earnest desire to see the scenery of this place, which had been
            described to them as so wonderful and sublime. Accordingly we departed from Geneva on
            this tour about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of
            Justine.</p>
          <p>The weather was uncommonly fine; and if mine had been a sorrow to be chased away by any
            fleeting circumstance, this excursion would certainly <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_212" n="193"/>have had the effect intended by my father. As it was, I was somewhat interested in the
            scene; it sometimes lulled, although it could not extinguish my grief. During the first
            day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the mountains at a distance,
            towards which we gradually advanced. We perceived that the valley through which we
            wound, and which was formed by the river Arve, whose course we followed, closed in upon
            us by degrees; and when the sun had set, we beheld immense mountains and precipices
            overhanging us on every side, and heard the sound of the river raging among rocks, and
            the dashing of water-falls around.<anchor id="struct37b" subtype="ide"/>

            was fine, although clouded. We visited the source of the Arveiron, and rode about the
            valley until evening. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest
            consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of
            feeling; and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.
            In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_217" n="198"/>brooded for the last month. I returned in the evening,
            fatigued, but less unhappy, and conversed with my family with more cheerfulness than had

            some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or
            transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
            of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly
            dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a

            I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_221" n="202"/>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the
            ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
            both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I
            descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a
            troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice
            is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
            mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was
            exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful
            majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous
            scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_222" n="203"/>whose <app id="var537" type="ide">

            icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was
            before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed—“Wandering spirits,
            if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness,
            or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.”</p>
          <p>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing
            towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I
            had walked with caution; his <app id="var538" type="ide">

            man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I
            was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came

            the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his
            approach, and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance
            bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
            ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this;

            may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember,
            thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints
            more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy

            Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and trample upon me alone, to whom

            I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. The
            desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the
            caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man
            does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your
            fellow-beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you
            do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I

            and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and
            deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only
            you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of
            its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale: when
            you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But
            hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they <app id="var550" type="sub">

            own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of
            murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh,
            praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me: listen to <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_229" n="210"/>me; and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the
            work of your hands.”</p>
          <p>“Why do you call to my <app id="var551" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances,</rdg>

            reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred
            devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that
            formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to
            consider whether I am just to you, or not. Begone! relieve me from the sight of your
            detested form.”</p>
          <p>“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes,
            which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.
            Still thou canst listen to me, and grant me thy <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_230" n="211"/>compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my
            tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your
            fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens;
            before it descends to hide itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another
            world, you will have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for
            ever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your
            fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy ruin.”</p>
          <p>As he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed. My heart was full, and I
            did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had
            used, and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity,
            and compas<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_231" n="212"/>sion confirmed my resolution. I had
            hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a
            confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the duties
            of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
            complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We
            crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the
            rain again began to descend: we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I
            with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen; and, seating
            myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.</p>

            the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of
            sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at the same time; and it was,
            indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various
            senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was
            obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but hardly had I
            felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_233" n="214"/>poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I believe,
            descended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and
            opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I
            could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or
            avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I
            walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near
            Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt
            tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate
            some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my
            thirst at the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>

            covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all
            was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds
            rung in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me: the only object that I
            could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.</p>
          <p>“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly <app id="var557" type="int">

            clear stream that supplied me with drink, and the trees that shaded me with their
            foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often
            saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_236" n="217"/>had often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began
            also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me, and to perceive
            the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to
            imitate the pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express
            my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from

                                <rdg>showed</rdg>

            itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had, by this time, become
            distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to
            the light, and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from
            the herb, and, by degrees, one herb from <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_237" n="218"/>another. I
            found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and
            thrush were sweet and enticing.</p>
          <p>“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some
            wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In
            my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry
            of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite
            effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of
            wood. I quickly collected some branches; but they were wet, and would not burn. I was
            pained at this, and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I
            had placed near the heat dried, and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this; <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_238" n="219"/>and, by touching the various branches, I discovered the
            cause, and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it,
            and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on, and brought sleep with it, I
            was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully
            with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak,
            I lay on the ground, and sunk into sleep.</p>
          <p>“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it,
            and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed this also, and contrived
            a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. When
            night came again, I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat; and 
            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_239" n="220"/>that the discovery of this element was useful to me
            in my food; for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been
            roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I
            tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I
            found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much
            improved.</p>
          <p>“Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a
            few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the
            place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced
            would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of
            the fire which I had obtained through accident, and knew not how to <app id="var559" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>re-produce</seg>

                            </app> <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_240" n="221"/>it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration
            of this difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it; and,
            wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I
            passed three days in these rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A great
            fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white;
            the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance
            that covered the ground.</p>
          <p>“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length
            I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the
            convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me; and I examined the structure
            with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I en<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_241" n="222"/>tered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.
            He turned on hearing a noise; and, perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and, quitting the
            hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared
            capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight,
            somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut: here the snow
            and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as
            exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their
            sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s
            breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did
            not like. <app id="var560" type="sub">
                                <rdg>Then, <seg>overcome</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> by fatigue, I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_242" n="223"/>lay down among
            some straw, and fell asleep.</p>
          <p>“It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly
            on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains
            of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for
            several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear!
            the huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The
            vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some
            of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had
            hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children shrieked, and one of the
            women fainted. The whole village <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_243" n="224"/>was roused; some
            fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of
            missile weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low
            hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in
            the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance;
            but, after my late <app id="var561" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge
            was constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No
            wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
            although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from
            the snow and rain.</p>
          <p>“Here then I retreated, and lay <app id="var562" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>down,</seg>

            more from the barbarity of man.</p>
          <p>“As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent
            cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated
            against the back of the cottage, and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a
            <app id="var563" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                                </rdg>
                            </app> and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but
            now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in
            such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out: all the light I enjoyed
            came through the <app id="var564" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>stye,</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> and that was sufficient for me.</p>
          <p>“Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired; for I
            saw the figure of a man at a <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_245" n="226"/>distance, and I
            remembered too well my treatment the night before, to trust myself in his power. I had
            first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse bread,
            which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink, more conveniently than from my
            hand, of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so
            that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
            tolerably warm.</p>
          <p>“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until something should occur
            which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise, compared to the bleak
            forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my
            breakfast with pleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
            water, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_246" n="227"/>when I heard a step, <app id="var565" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>and,</seg>

                            </app> looking through a
            small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my
            hovel. The girl was <app id="var566" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>young</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
            cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue
            petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited, but not
            adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of her; and in about a quarter of an
            hour she returned, bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she
            walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance
            expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took
            the pail from her head, and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they
            disappeared. Presently I saw the young <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_247" n="228"/>man again,
            with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also
            busied, sometimes in the house, and sometimes in the yard.</p>
          <p>“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly
            occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a
            small and almost imperceptible chink, through which the eye could just penetrate.
            Through this <app id="var567" type="int">
                                <rdg>crevice</rdg>
                            </app> a small room was visible, <app id="var568" type="ort">
                                <rdg>whitewashed</rdg>
                            </app> and clean, but very bare of
            furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his
            hands in a disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage;
            but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
            down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play, and to pro<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_248" n="229"/>duce <app id="var569" type="int">
                                <rdg>sounds</rdg>
                            </app> sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
            nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld aught
            beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged <app id="var570" type="int">
                                <rdg>cottager</rdg>
                            </app> won my
            <app id="var571" type="int">
                                <rdg>reverence,</rdg>
                            </app> while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet
            mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
            which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few
            sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and
            smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and
            overpowering nature: they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never
            before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_249" n="230"/>withdrew from the window, unable to bear these
            emotions.</p>
          <p>“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The
            girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and, taking some of the
            fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a
            nook of the cottage, and he <app id="var572" type="ort">
                                <rdg>showed</rdg>
                            </app> her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed
            pleased, and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water,
            and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went
            into the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he
            had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him, and they entered the
            cottage together. </p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_250" n="231"/>“The old man had, in the mean time, been pensive;
            but, on the appearance of his companions, he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat
            down to eat. The meal was quickly <app id="var573" type="ort">
                                <rdg>despatched.</rdg>
                            </app> The young woman was again occupied in
            arranging the cottage; the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few
            minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast
            between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance
            beaming with benevolence and love: the younger was slight and graceful in his figure,
            and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and attitude
            expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage; and
            the youth, with tools different from those he had used <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_251" n="232"/>in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.</p>
          <p>“Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a
            means of prolonging <app id="var574" type="int">
                                <rdg>light</rdg>

                            </app> that the
            setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human
            neighbours. In the evening, the young girl and her companion were employed in various
            occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the <app id="var576" type="int">

                            </app>
            which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had
            finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and
            neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument <app id="var577" type="ide">

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_254" n="235"/>“The cottagers arose the next morning before the
            sun. The young woman arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed
            after the first meal.</p>
          <p>“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was
            constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.
            The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his
            <app id="var580" type="int">
                                <rdg>instrument</rdg>
                            </app> or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the
            younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards
            him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness; and he rewarded them by
            his benevolent smiles.</p>
          <p>“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_255" n="236"/>went apart, and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for
            their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were
            miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be
            wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house
            (for such it was in my <app id="var581" type="int">
                                <rdg>eyes)</rdg>
                            </app> and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill,
            and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still
            more, they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of
            affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was
            at first unable to solve these questions; but perpetual <app id="var582" type="int">
                                <rdg>attention</rdg>

            me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.</p>

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_256" n="237"/>“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered
            one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable <app id="var584" type="int">
                                <rdg>family:</rdg>
                            </app> it was <app id="var585" type="int">

                            </app> and they
            suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of
            the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow, <app id="var586" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>who</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> gave very little during the
            winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I
            believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger
            cottagers; for several times they placed food before the old man, when they reserved
            none for themselves.</p>
          <p>“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to
            steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but when I found that in doing this
            I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_257" n="238"/>and
            satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a neighbouring
            wood.</p>
          <p>“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. I
            found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family
            fire; and, during the night, I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly
            discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.</p>
          <p>“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door
            in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the
            outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also
            expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that
            day, but spent it in repair<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_258" n="239"/>ing the cottage, and
            cultivating the garden.</p>
          <p>“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people
            possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by
            articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke <app id="var587" type="int">
                                <rdg>sometimes,</rdg>
                            </app> produced pleasure or
            pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a
            godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled
            in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the words
            they uttered, not having any apparent <app id="var588" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>connexion</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> with visible objects, I was unable to
            discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great
            application, however, and after having re<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_259" n="240"/>mained
            during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names
            that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied
            the <app id="var589" type="int">
                                <rdg>words,</rdg>
                            </app> <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, <hi rend="italic">milk</hi>, <hi rend="italic">bread</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">wood</hi>. I learned also the names of the
            cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but
            the old man had only one, which was <hi rend="italic">father</hi>. The girl was called <hi rend="italic">sister</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Agatha</hi>; and the youth <hi rend="italic">Felix</hi>, <hi rend="italic">brother</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">son</hi>. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated
            to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other
            words, without being able as yet to understand or apply them; such as <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dearest</hi>, <hi rend="italic">unhappy</hi>.</p>
          <p>“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_260" n="240"/>cottagers greatly endeared them to me: when they were
            unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I <app id="var590" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>sympathized</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> in their joys. I saw few
            human beings beside them; and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh
            manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.
            The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes
            I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful
            accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha
            listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to
            wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more
            cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with
            Felix. He <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_261" n="242"/>was always the saddest of the <app id="var591" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>groupe;</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> and,
            even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
            friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than
            that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.</p>
          <p>“I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked the dispositions
            of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with
            pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the
            snowy ground. Early in the <app id="var592" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>morning</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
            obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood
            from the out-house, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always
              reple<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_262" n="243"/>nished by an invisible hand. In the day, I
            believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth, and
            did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in
            the garden; but, as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man
            and Agatha.</p>
          <p>“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I discovered that he
            uttered many of the same sounds when he <app id="var593" type="int">
                                <rdg>read,</rdg>
                            </app> as when he talked. I conjectured,
            therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I
            ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible, when I did not even
            understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in
            this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_263" n="244"/>conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily
            perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought
            not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which
            knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with
            this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>
          <p>“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate
            complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At
            first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the
            mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I
            was filled with the bitterest sen<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_264" n="245"/>sations of
            despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of
            this miserable deformity.</p>
          <p>“As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld
            the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more <app id="var594" type="int">
                                <rdg>employed:</rdg>
                            </app> and the
            heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards
            found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several
            new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of
            comfort increased daily as the season advanced.</p>
          <p>“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I
            found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_265" n="246"/>This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly
            dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.</p>
          <p>“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the <app id="var595" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>morning</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> I attended the motions of
            the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the
            remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest,
            if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected
            my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I
            cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by
            Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly
            astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_266" n="246"/>occasions, utter the words <hi rend="italic">good spirit</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi>; but I did not then understand the signification of these
            terms.</p>
          <p>“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings
            of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable,
            and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore
            happiness to these deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the
            venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before me. I
            looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I
            formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their
            reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour
            and conciliating <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_267" n="248"/>words, I should first win their
            favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
          <p>“These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring
            the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was
            very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood
            with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle <app id="var596" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> whose
            intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment
            than blows and execration.</p>
          <p>“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the
            earth. Men, who <app id="var597" type="ort">

                            <comment text="ebb: printer error"/> this change seemed to have been hid in caves, dispersed
            themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more
              cheer<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_268" n="249"/>ful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth
            on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time
            before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting
            appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and
            the future gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.”</p>

            listened to <app id="var603" type="sub">
                                <rdg>him—that I</rdg>

                            </app> countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond
            expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music, and I
            conjectured by his manner that he <app id="var605" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied
            in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his <app id="var606" type="int">
                                <rdg>music,</rdg>
                            </app> when some one tapped
            at the door.</p>
          <p>“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was
            dressed in a dark suit, <app id="var607" type="ort">
                                <rdg>an</rdg>
                            </app> covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to
            which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.
            Her voice was musical, but unlike that of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_276" n="3"/>either of my
            friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him,
            threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair
            of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle,
            although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously
            fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</p>
          <p>“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished
            from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could
            hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure;
            and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by
            different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_277" n="4"/>she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as
            well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him,
            but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, <app id="var608" type="int">
                                <rdg>and</rdg>
                            </app> dismissing her guide, conducted her into
            the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young
            stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her,
            and embraced her affectionately.<comment text=" RM: edit to here 05/03/2017 "/>
                        </p>
          <p>“I soon perceived, that <app id="var609" type="ort">
                                <rdg>althoug</rdg>
                            </app> the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to
            have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, <app id="var610" type="ort">
                                <rdg>nor</rdg>
                            </app> herself understood, the
            cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her presence
            diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
            morning mists. Felix <app id="var611" type="ort">
                                <rdg>seeme</rdg>
                            </app> <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_278" n="5"/>peculiarly happy, and with
            smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands
            <app id="var612" type="sub">
                                <rdg>. <seg>of</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me
            to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they,
            by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently
            I found, by the frequent recurrence of <app id="var613" type="ort">
                                <rdg>some</rdg>
                            </app> sound which the stranger repeated after
            them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred
            to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger
            learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of <app id="var614" type="int">
                                <rdg>them, indeed,</rdg>
                            </app> were those which I
            had before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>
          <p>“As night came on, Agatha and the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_279" n="6"/>Arabian retired
            early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good
            night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the
            frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject
            of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty
            towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
          <p>“The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of
            Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his
            guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of
            sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence,
            swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_280" n="7"/>“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha,
            who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet
            accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared
            enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by
            which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by
            her music.</p>
          <p>“The days now passed as <app id="var615" type="ort">
                                <rdg>peaceably</rdg>
                            </app> as before, with the sole <app id="var616" type="int">
                                <rdg>alteration,</rdg>
                            </app> that joy had
            taken <app id="var617" type="sub">

                            </app> of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and
            happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I
            began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>
          <p>“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_281" n="8"/>the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers,
            sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the
            sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme
            pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early
            rising of the sun; for I never ventured abroad during <app id="var618" type="ort">
                                <rdg>daylight,</rdg>
                            </app> fearful of meeting with

                                </rdg>
                            </app> had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.</p>
          <p>“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language;
            and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very
            little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost
            every word that was spoken.</p>
          <p>“While I improved in speech, I also <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_282" n="9"/>learned the
            science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide
            field for wonder and delight.</p>
          <p>“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s <hi rend="italic">Ruins of
              Empires</hi>. I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in
            reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because
            the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work
            I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the several empires at present
            existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and
            religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of
            the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful
            virtue of the early Romans—of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_283" n="10"/>their subsequent
            <app id="var620" type="ort">
                                <rdg>degenerating—of</rdg>
                            </app> the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.
            I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the
            hapless fate of its original inhabitants.</p>
          <p>“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once
            so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one
            time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at <app id="var621" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>another</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> as all that can be conceived of
            noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can
            befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared
            the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless
            worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his
            fellow, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_284" n="11"/>or even why there were laws and governments;
            but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with
            disgust and loathing.</p>
          <p>“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to
            the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human
            society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and
            squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>
          <p>“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most
            esteemed by your <app id="var622" type="ort">

            considered, except in very rare instances, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_285" n="12"/>as a

            what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I
            possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, <app id="var627" type="ort">
                                <rdg>endued</rdg>
                            </app> with a
            figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was
            more agile than they, and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat
            and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked
            around, I saw and heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth,
            from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?</p>
          <p>“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon <app id="var628" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>me;</seg>

                            </app> I tried
            to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_286" n="13"/>I had <app id="var629" type="sub">

                            </app>
            felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!</p>
          <p>“ Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized
            on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and
            feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain,
            and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and
            good feelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I
            was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by
            stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the
            desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_287" n="14"/>the animated smiles of the charming Arabian, were not
            for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the loved
            Felix, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>
          <p>“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of <app id="var631" type="sub">

            of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to
            another in mutual bonds.</p>
          <p>“ But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no
            mother had blessed me <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_288" n="15"/>with smiles and caresses; or if
            they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished
            nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.
            I had never yet seen a being resembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What
            was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.</p>
          <p>“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to return to the
            cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and

          <p>“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France,
            where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved
            by <app id="var638" type="sub">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> His son was bred in the ser<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_290" n="17"/>vice of his
            country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months
            before my arrival, they had lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris,
            surrounded by friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of
            intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p>
          <p>“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and
            had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he
            became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that
            Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The
            injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged
            that his religion and wealth, rather than the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_291" n="18"/>crime
            alleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation.</p>
          <p>“Felix had <app id="var639" type="sub">
                                <rdg>accidentally <seg>been</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> present at the trial; his horror and indignation were
            uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a
            solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless
            attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
            unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan;
            who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.
            Felix visited the grate at night, and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his
            favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
            by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt; yet <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_292" n="19"/>when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit
            her father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could
            not help owning to his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully
            reward his toil and hazard.</p>
          <p>“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of
            Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of
            her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was
            too delicate to accept this offer; yet he looked forward to the probability of the event
            as to <app id="var640" type="ort">
                                <rdg>the</rdg>
                            </app> consummation of his happiness.</p>
          <p>“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of
            the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_293" n="20"/>that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her
            thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her <app id="var641" type="ort">
                                <rdg>father,</rdg>
                            </app>
            who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended
            services towards her <app id="var642" type="sub">
                                <rdg>parent;</rdg>
                            </app> and at the same time <app id="var643" type="sub">
                                <rdg>she gently</rdg>
                            </app> deplored her own fate.</p>
          <p>“I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in the hovel,
            to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix
            or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them to you, they will prove the truth of my
            tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to
            repeat the substance of them to you.</p>
          <p>“Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the
            Turks; recommended by <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_294" n="21"/>her beauty, she had won the
            heart of the father of <app id="var644" type="ort">

                            </app> who married her. The young girl spoke in high and
            enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in <app id="var645" type="int">
                                <rdg>freedom,</rdg>
                            </app> spurned the bondage to which she
            was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion, and taught
            her to aspire to higher powers of intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to
            the female followers of Mahomet. This lady died; but her lessons were indelibly
            impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia,
            and <app id="var646" type="sub">

            ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian, and
            remaining in a country where <app id="var648" type="ort">

          <p>“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night previous to it, he
            <app id="var650" type="sub">

            procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously
            communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
            the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part
            of Paris.</p>
          <p>“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to
            Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into
            some part of the Turkish dominions.</p>
          <p>“Safie resolved to remain with her father until <app id="var651" type="ort">
                                <rdg>this</rdg>

            that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation
            of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited
            towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another
            through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and
            Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.</p>
          <p>“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes of the youthful
            lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his
            daughter should be united to a Christian; but he feared the resentment of <app id="var652" type="int">
                                <rdg>Felix,</rdg>
                            </app> if he
            should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer, if
            he should choose to betray <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_297" n="24"/>him to the Italian state
            which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to
            prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his
            daughter with him when he departed. His plans were <app id="var653" type="ide">

            arrived from Paris.</p>
          <p>“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim, and
            spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly
            discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix, and
            roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister,
            lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her whom he
            loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the <app id="var654" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>Turk,</seg>

              lat<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_298" n="25"/>ter should find a favourable opportunity for
            escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent
            at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and delivered
            himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this
            proceeding.</p>
          <p>“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took
            place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune, and condemned them to a
            perpetual exile from their native country.</p>
          <p>“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.
            Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such
            unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and

            Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.
            The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.</p>
          <p>“When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the
            merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_300" n="27"/>lover, but to prepare to return <app id="var660" type="sub">

            was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left
            her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.</p>
          <p>“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment, and told her hastily,
            that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn <app id="var661" type="ort">

            a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.
            He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at
            her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at
            Leghorn.</p>
          <p>“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_301" n="28"/>would become her to pursue in this emergency. A
            residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike
            adverse to it. By some papers of her <app id="var663" type="ort">

            customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the

          <p>“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I learned, from
            the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues, and to deprecate
            the vices of mankind.</p>
          <p>“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence and generosity were ever
            present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene
            where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But, in giving an
            account of the progress of my intellect, I must <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_304" n="31"/>not
            omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same
            year.</p>
          <p>“One night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I collected my
            own food, and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern
            portmanteau, containing several articles of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the
            prize, and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the

            and the <hi rend="italic">Sorrows of Werter</hi>. The possession of these treasures gave
            me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these
            histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_305" n="32"/>“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these
            books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised
            me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the <hi rend="italic">Sorrows of Werter</hi>, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
            story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto
            been to me obscure subjects, that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and
            astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty
            sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well
            with my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which were for ever alive in
            my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_306" n="33"/>imagined; his character contained no pretension, but
            it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with
            wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
            the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding
            it.</p>
          <p>“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I
            found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike <app id="var670" type="sub">

                                <rdg>possessed</rdg>
                            </app> contained the
            histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far different
            effect upon me from the <hi rend="italic">Sorrows of Werter</hi>. I learned from
            Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he
            elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the
            heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had
            a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and
            boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_308" n="35"/>large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors
            had been the only school in which I had studied human nature; but this book developed
            new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public <app id="var676" type="int">
                                <rdg>affairs,</rdg>
                            </app> governing
            or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and
            abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative
            as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings,
            I was of course led to admire peaceable <app id="var677" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>law-givers,</rdg>
                            </app> Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in
            preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these
            impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to
            humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_309" n="36"/>slaughter, I should have been imbued with <app id="var678" type="int">
                                <rdg>different:</rdg>

            sensations.</p>
          <p>“But <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> excited different and far deeper emotions. I
            read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true
            history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God
            warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several
            situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was <app id="var679" type="sub">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> united
            by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in
            every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy
            and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse
            with, and acquire knowledge <app id="var680" type="ide">

            fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my
            protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.</p>
          <p>“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival
            in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from
            your laboratory. At first I had neglected them; but now that I was able to <app id="var681" type="ort">

            accounts of domestic occurrences. You, doubtless, recollect <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_311" n="38"/>these papers. Here they are. Every thing is related in them which bears
            reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting

          <p>“These were the reflections of my <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_312" n="39"/>hours of
            despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their
            amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become
            acquainted with my admiration of their virtues, they would compassionate me, and
            overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous,
            who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but
            in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I
            postponed this attempt for some months longer; for the importance attached to its
            success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my
            understanding improved so much with every day’s experience, that I was unwilling to
            commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my <app id="var689" type="ide">

            cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants; and I also
            found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in
            amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not
            appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful,
            while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me
            more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true; but it
            vanished, when I beheld my person reflected in water, or my shadow in the <app id="var691" type="ort">

          <p>“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and
            nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the
            woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better
            fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_315" n="42"/>delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and
            all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
            towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They
            loved, and <app id="var699" type="ide">

            not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them,
            the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to
            be known and loved by these amiable creatures: to see their sweet looks <app id="var700" type="ide">

            me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they
            would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door
            were never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or

          <p>“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I
            awoke into life. My attention, at this time, was solely directed towards my plan of
            introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects; but that
            on which I finally fixed was, to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be
            alone. I had sagacity enough to discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person
            was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although
            harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if, in the absence of his
            children, I could gain the good-will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might, by his
            means, be tolerated by my younger protectors.</p>

            alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar, and played

            absorbed in reflection.</p>

          <p>“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I

            despair.’</p>
          <p>“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately,

            lose; but, seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the time!—save and protect

            Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on
            beholding me? Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of
            the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father,
            to whose knees I clung: in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the <app id="var717" type="int">

                            </app> It was apparent that my conversation had interested
            the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of
            his children. I ought to have <app id="var727" type="ide">

            have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared
            for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable; and, after much
            consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my
            representations win him to my party.</p>
          <p>“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the
            fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene
            of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_329" n="56"/>and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father’s feet.
            I awoke exhausted; and, finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my
            <app id="var728" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>hiding-place,</rdg>
                            </app> and went in search of food.</p>
          <p>“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the <app id="var729" type="ort">
                                <rdg>wellknown</rdg>
                            </app> path that
            conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my hovel, and remained in
            silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour past, the sun
            mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently,
            apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard
            no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this <app id="var730" type="ort">
                                <rdg>suspense.</rdg>
                            </app>
                        </p>
          <p>“Presently two countrymen passed <app id="var731" type="sub int">

                            </app> but, pausing near the cottage, they entered into
            conversation, using violent <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_330" n="57"/>gesticulations; but I did
            not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed
            from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man: I
            was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited
            anxiously to discover, from his discourse, the meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>
          <p>“‘Do you consider,‘ said his companion to him, <app id="var732" type="sub ort">

                            </app> violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage,

                                <rdg>departed</rdg>
                            </app> I never saw any of the
            family of De Lacey more.</p>
          <p>“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid
            despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only link that held me to the
            world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did
            not strive to <app id="var737" type="ort">
                                <rdg>control</rdg>
                            </app> them; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent
            my mind towards injury and death. <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_332" n="59"/>When I thought of my
            friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite
            beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.
            But again, when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a
            rage of anger; and, unable to injure any thing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate
            objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and,
            after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced
            impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.</p>
          <p>“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly dispersed the
            clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore along like a mighty <app id="var738" type="ort">
                                <rdg>avelânche,</rdg>
                            </app>
            and produced <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_333" n="60"/>a kind of insanity in my spirits, that
            burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree, and
            danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon,
            the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I
            waved my brand; it sunk, and, with a loud scream, I fired the straw, and heath, and
            bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly
            enveloped by the flames, which clung to it, and licked it with their forked and
            destroying tongues.</p>
          <p>“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I
            quitted the scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.</p>
          <p>“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my <app id="var739" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>steps ?</rdg>
                            </app> I resolved to fly
            far from the scene of my <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_334" n="61"/>misfortunes; but to me, hated
            and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you
            crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to
            whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among the
            lessons that Felix had bestowed upon <app id="var740" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>Safie</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> geography had not been omitted: I had learned
            from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had
            mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town; and towards this place I resolved to
            proceed.</p>
          <p>“But how was I to direct <app id="var741" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>myself ?</rdg>
                            </app> I knew that I must travel in a <app id="var742" type="ort">
                                <rdg>southwesterly</rdg>
                            </app>
            direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my only guide. I did not know the
            names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single
            human <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_334" n="61"/>being; but I did not despair. From you only
            could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.
            Unfeeling, heartless creator! you had endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then
            cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any
            claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I
            vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.</p>
          <p>“ My travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in autumn
            when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night,
            fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the
            sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_336" n="63"/>frozen; the surface of the earth was <app id="var743" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>hard,</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> and chill,
            and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on the
            cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to
            gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I
            feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were
            <app id="var744" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>hardened,</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a
            map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings
            allowed me no respite: no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not
            extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of
            Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_337" n="64"/>green, confirmed in an especial manner the
            bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>
          <p>“I generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was secured by night from
            the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I
            ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the
            first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
            the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive
            within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be
            borne away by them; and, forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft
            tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards
            the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_338" n="65"/>blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me.</p>
          <p>“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which
            was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches,
            now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to
            pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the
            shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot
            where I was concealed, <app id="var745" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>laughing</seg>

                            </app> as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued her
            course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she
            fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my <app id="var746" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>hiding-place, aud,</rdg>
                            </app> with extreme labour from
            the force of the current, saved her, and dragged her <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_339" n="66"/>to shore. She was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore
            animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably
            the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, <app id="var747" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>and,</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app>
            tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed
            speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he
            carried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with increased
            swiftness, escaped into the wood.</p>
          <p>“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from
            destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound,
            which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_340" n="67"/>of
            kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few moments before, gave place to
            hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and
            vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I
            fainted.</p>
          <p>“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound
            which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had
            remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means <app id="var748" type="ort">
                                <rdg>df</rdg>
                            </app> extracting it. My
            sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude
            of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as
            would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_341" n="68"/>“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my
            journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
            gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my desolate state,
            and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.</p>
          <p>“But my toils now drew near a close; and, <app id="var749" type="sub">
                                <rdg>in <seg>two</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> months from this time, I reached the
            environs of Geneva.</p>
          <p>“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that
            surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by
            fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening, or the
            prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.</p>
          <p>“At this time a slight sleep relieved <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_342" n="69"/>me from the
            pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
            running into the recess I had <app id="var750" type="int">
                                <rdg>chosen,</rdg>
                            </app> with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as
            I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced, and had
            lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could
            seize him, and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in
            this peopled earth.</p>
          <p>“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him towards me. As
            soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes, and uttered a shrill
            scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face, and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of
            this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_343" n="70"/>“He struggled <app id="var751" type="ide">

            it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and
            attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep
            lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned: I remembered that I was for
            ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and that she
            whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine
            benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.</p>

            I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand
            the full extent of his proposition. He continued—</p>
          <p>“You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those
            sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do; and I demand it of you as a

          <p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_348" n="75"/>died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the
            cottagers, and, as he said this, I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within
            me.</p>
          <p>“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You
            may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own
            eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the
            world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”</p>
          <p>“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and, instead of threatening, I am content

            You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts,
            and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man, when he contemns

                            </app> and, instead of injury, I would
            bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot
            be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the
            submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my <app id="var774" type="sub int">

          <p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent; but
            I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale, and the feelings he now
            expressed, proved him to be a creature of fine sensations; and did I <app id="var779" type="int">

            owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change
            of feeling, and continued—</p>
          <p>“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_352" n="79"/>again: I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My

            acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same
            nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried
            leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I
            present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in
            the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see
            compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment, and persuade you to promise
            what I so ardently desire.”</p>
          <p>“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_353" n="80"/>in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be
            your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere
            in this exile? You will return, and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with

          <p>“How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by my
            representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you,
            by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that, with the companion you

          <p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes felt a wish
            to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and
            talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I
            tried to stifle these sensations; I thought, that as I could not <app id="var785" type="ide">

            ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues
            will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the
            affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the chain of existence and events,
            from which I am now excluded.“</p>
          <p>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various argu<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_356" n="83"/>ments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of
            virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent
            blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had
            manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a
            creature who could exist in the <app id="var791" type="sub">
                                <rdg>ice-caves</rdg>
                            </app> of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit
            among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would
            be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I <app id="var792" type="int">
                                <rdg>concluded</rdg>
                            </app> that the justice due
            both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his
            request. Turning to him, therefore, I said—</p>
          <p>“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other
            place in the neighbour<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_357" n="84"/>hood of man, as soon as I shall
            deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”</p>
          <p>“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of <app id="var793" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

          <p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments.
            I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and
            quickly lost <app id="var795" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

          <p>His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when
            he departed. I knew <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_358" n="85"/>that I ought to hasten my descent
            towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy,
            and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountains, and
            fixing my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions
            which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced, <app id="var796" type="ort">
                                <rdg>Vhen</rdg>
                            </app> I came to

                            </app> and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at
            intervals, as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every
            here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity,
            and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly; <app id="var798" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> and leave me in darkness.”</p>
          <p>These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the eternal
            twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened to every blast of wind, as if
            it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.</p>
          <p>
                            <anchor id="struct43a" subtype="ide"/>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; but my presence, so
            haggard and strange, hardly calmed the fears of my family, who had waited the whole
            night in anxious expectation of my return.</p>
          <p>The following day we returned to Geneva. The intention of my father in coming had been
            to divert my mind, and to restore me to my lost tranquillity; but the medicine had been
            fatal. And, unable to account for the excess of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_360" n="87"/>misery
            I appeared to suffer, he hastened to return home, hoping the quiet and monotony of a
            domestic life would by degrees alleviate my sufferings from <app id="var1359" type="ort">
                                <rdg>whatever</rdg>
                            </app> cause they might
            spring.</p>
          <p>For myself, I was passive in all their arrangements; and the gentle affection of my
            beloved Elizabeth was inadequate to draw me from the depth of my despair. The promise I
            had made to the dæmon weighed upon my mind, like Dante’s iron cowl on the heads of the
            hellish hypocrites. All pleasures of earth and sky passed before me like a dream, and
            that thought only had to me the reality of life. Can you wonder, that sometimes a kind
            of insanity possessed me, or that I saw continually about me a multitude of filthy
            animals inflicting on me incessant torture, that often extorted screams and bitter
            groans?</p>

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_361" n="88"/>By degrees, however, these feelings became calmed. I
            entered again into the every-day scene of life, if not with interest, at least with some

          <p>Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not
            collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed
            fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I
            found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to
            profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been
            made by <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_363" n="90"/>an English philosopher, the knowledge of which
            was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to
            visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and <app id="var801" type="ide">

                            </app> health, which had hitherto declined,
            was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy
            promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his
            thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which
            every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the
            approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I
            passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_364" n="91"/>watching the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.
            But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of
            composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
            and a more cheerful heart.</p>
          <p>It was after my return from one of these <app id="var803" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>rambles</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> that my father, calling me aside, thus
            addressed me:—</p>
          <p>“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and
            seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our
            society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday
            an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such
            a point would be not only use<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_365" n="92"/>less, but draw down
            treble misery on us all.”</p>
          <p>I trembled violently at <app id="var804" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> exordium, and my father continued—</p>
          <p>“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with <app id="var805" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            as the tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my declining years. You were
            attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared,
            in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the
            experience of man, that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my <app id="var806" type="ide">

            entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that
            she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and,
            considering yourself as bound in <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_366" n="93"/>honour to <app id="var807" type="ide">

          <p>“My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never

            future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”</p>
          <p>“The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more
            pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be
            happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this <app id="var809" type="int">

                            </app> which
            appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,

            been unfortunate, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_367" n="94"/>and recent events have drawn us from
            that every-day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I
            do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage
            would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have
            formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or that a
            delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with
            candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.”</p>
          <p>I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering
            any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to
            arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my <app id="var811" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> was
            one of horror and dismay. I was bound <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_368" n="95"/>by a solemn
            promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold
            miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival
            with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must
            perform my engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself
            to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected peace.</p>
          <p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England, or
            entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country, whose
            knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The
            latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory:

                            <anchor id="struct47a" subtype="ide"/>I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced to comply; for a
            more indulgent and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_370" n="97"/>less dictatorial parent did not
            exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to <app id="var1360" type="ort">

            Clerval would join me. Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland, and our
            principal stay would be in England. We should return by France; and it was agreed that
            the tour should occupy the space of two years.</p>
          <p>My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with Elizabeth should take
            place immediately on my return to Geneva. “These two years,” said he, “will pass
            swiftly, and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness. And,
            indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive, when we shall all be united, and
            neither hopes or fears arise to disturb our domestic calm.”</p>
          <p>“I am content,” I replied, “ with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_371" n="98"/>your arrangement.
            By that time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we at present

          <p>I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me, which filled me
            with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the
            existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be
            by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; <app id="var828" type="ort">

            accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch
            as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was <app id="var829" type="ide">

            through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature, I allowed myself
            to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly
            intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family from the danger of his

          <p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I
            arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was

            scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld
            it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the
            landscape, and the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried, “now
            I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and

          <p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_375" n="102"/>in a boat from
            Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage,

            rapidly, and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw
            many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high
            and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated
            landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous
            precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a
            promontory, flourishing vineyards, with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_376" n="103"/>green sloping

            He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom
            tasted by man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I

            impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for
            the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this
            lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an

            are more majestic and strange; but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river,
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_378" n="105"/>that I never before saw equalled. Look at that
            castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed

            among their vines; and that village <app id="var852" type="sub">

          <p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the
            unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which
            his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale.</p>
          <p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the
            remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream of the river was too
            gentle to aid us.</p>
          <p>Our journey here lost the interest <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_381" n="108"/>arising from
            beautiful scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea
            to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw
            the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were
            flat, but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We

          <p>London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this
            wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and
            talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a secondary object; I was
            principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
            completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that
            I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.</p>
          <p>If this journey had taken place during <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_383" n="110"/>my days of
            study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had
            come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information
            they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company
            was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth;
            the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.
            But busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an
            insurmountable barrier placed between me and my <app id="var866" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>fellow men;</rdg>
                            </app> this barrier was sealed with
            the blood of William and Justine; and to reflect on the events connected with those
            names filled my soul with anguish.</p>
          <p>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_384" n="111"/>anxious to gain experience and instruction. The
            difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
            instruction and amusement. <app id="var867" type="ide">

                                <rdg>mind.</rdg>
                            </app> I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I
            might not debar him from the pleasures natural to <app id="var869" type="int">

                            </app> who was entering on a new scene
            of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany
            him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect
            the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of
            single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to
            it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_385" n="112"/>caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to
            palpitate.</p>
          <p>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland,
            who had formerly been our <app id="var870" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>visitor</seg>

                            </app> at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native
            country, and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong
            our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept
            this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and
            streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
            dwelling-places.</p>
          <p>We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We
            accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of
            another month. In this expedition we did not <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_386" n="113"/>intend
            to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the
            Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of
            July. I packed up my chemical instruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving
            to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.</p>
          <p>We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in
            its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us <app id="var871" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>mountaineers ;</rdg>
                            </app> the majestic oaks, the
            quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us.</p>
          <p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with
            the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a
            half <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_3873" n="114"/>before. It was here that Charles I. had
            collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had
            forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory of that
            unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent <app id="var872" type="sub">
                                <rdg>Goring,</rdg>
                            </app> his
            queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be
            supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we
            delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary
            gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain
            our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
            magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite
            verdure, is spread forth into a <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_388" n="115"/>placid expanse of
            waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes,
            embosomed among aged trees.</p>
          <p>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the
            past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my
            youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of
            what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart,
            and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered
            my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to
            be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and <app id="var873" type="sub">
                                <rdg>intolerable</rdg>
                            </app> to
            myself.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_389" n="116"/>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling
            among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the
            most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often
            prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of
            the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul
            was elevated from its debasing and miserable <app id="var874" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>fears</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> to contemplate the divine ideas of
            liberty and <app id="var875" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>self sacrifice,</rdg>
                            </app> of which these sights were the monuments and the
            remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a
            free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling
            and hopeless, into my miserable self.</p>
          <p>We left Oxford with regret, and pro<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_390" n="117"/>ceeded to
            Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this
            village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but <app id="var876" type="sub">
                                <rdg>every thing</rdg>
                            </app> is
            on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps, which always
            attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave, and the
            little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
            manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble,
            when pronounced by Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene
            was thus associated.</p>
          <p>From <app id="var877" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> still journeying northward, we passed two months in Cumberland and
            <app id="var878" type="ort">
                                <rdg>Westmorland.</rdg>
                            </app> I could now almost fancy myself among the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_391" n="118"/>Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides
            of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams, were all familiar and
            dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat
            me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was <app id="var879" type="ort">
                                <rdg>proportionally</rdg>
                            </app> greater than mine; his mind
            expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater
            capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he
            associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life here, said he to me; “and among
            these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”</p>
          <p>But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its
            enjoyments. His feelings are for ever <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_392" n="119"/>on the stretch;
            and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which
            he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which
            also he forsakes for other novelties.</p>
          <p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and <app id="var880" type="ort">
                                <rdg>Westmorland,</rdg>
                            </app> and conceived
            an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our
            Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not
            sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the
            dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my
            relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every moment from which I might
            otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish im<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_393" n="120"/>patience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and
            overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived, and I saw the superscription of
            Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I
            thought that the fiend followed me, and might expedite my remissness by murdering my
            companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but
            followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I
            felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I
            was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as
            that of crime.</p>
          <p>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested
            the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_394" n="121"/>as <app id="var881" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>Oxford;</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But
            the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle, and its
            environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the
            Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and
            admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>
          <p>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrews, and along the banks
            of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to laugh and
            talk with strangers, or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected
            from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
            alone. “Do you,” said I, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_395" n="122"/>“enjoy yourself, and let
            this be our <app id="var882" type="int">
                                <rdg>rendezvous,</rdg>
                            </app> I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my
            motions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I
            return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.”</p>
          <p>Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.
            He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary
            rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know: hasten then, my dear friend,
            to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your
            absence.”</p>
          <p>Having parted from my friend, <app id="var883" type="sub">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>determined</seg>

                            </app> to visit some remote spot of Scotland, and
            finish my work in soli<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_396" n="123"/>tude. I did not doubt but that
            the monster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should have finished,
            that he might receive his companion.</p>
          <p>With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on one of the
            remotest of the Orkneys as the scene <app id="var884" type="sub">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>labours.</seg>

                            </app> It was a place fitted for such a work,
            being hardly more than a rock, whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the
            waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and
            oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy
            limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in
            such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the main land, which was
            about five miles distant.</p>
          <p>On the whole island there were but <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_397" n="124"/>three miserable
            huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained <app id="var885" type="ort">
                                <rdg>hut</rdg>
                            </app> two
            rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch
            had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it
            to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession; an incident which would,
            doubtless, have occasioned some surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been
            benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested,
            hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering
            blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.</p>
          <p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather
            permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea, to listen to <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_398" n="125"/>

            this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its
            cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle
            sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
            infant, when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.</p>
          <p>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but, as I proceeded
            in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not
            prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days; and at other times I toiled
            day and night in order to complete my work. It <app id="var890" type="ide">

            my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the
            work of my hands.</p>
          <p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where
            nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was
            engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared
            to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to
            raise <app id="var892" type="ide">

            feared to wander <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_400" n="127"/>from the sight of my
            fellow-creatures, lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.</p>
          <p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked
            towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself
            to question, but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil, that made my
            heart sicken in my bosom.</p>

                            </app> one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from
            the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause
            of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night, or hasten its
            conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred
            to me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before
            I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity
            had desolated my <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_402" n="129"/>heart, and filled it for ever with
            the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I
            was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate,
            and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the
            neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in all
            probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a
            compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who
            already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
            for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust
            from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone,
            exasperated by the fresh <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_403" n="130"/>provocation of being
            deserted by one of his own species.</p>
          <p>Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of
            the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children,
            and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth, who might make the very
            existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I <app id="var895" type="ide">

            before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck
            senseless by his fiendish threats: but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
            promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their
            pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_404" n="131"/>the <app id="var896" type="ide">

          <p>I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw, by the light of
            the moon, the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me,
            where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in
            my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
            and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress, and claim the <app id="var897" type="ort">

            promise.</p>
          <p>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and
            treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like
            <app id="var898" type="sub int">

          <p>I <app id="var900" type="int">
                                <rdg>left,</rdg>

            resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was
            alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the sickening
            oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
          <p>Several hours <app id="var901" type="ort">
                                <rdg>past,</rdg>
                            </app> and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost
            motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet
            moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze
            wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
            although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_406" n="133"/>until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore,
            and a person landed close to my house.</p>
          <p>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to
            open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was, and
            wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was
            overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you
            in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.</p>
          <p>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the
            wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me, and said, in a
            smothered voice—</p>
          <p>“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_407" n="134"/>Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil
            and misery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among
            its willow islands, and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the
            heaths of England, and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable
            fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?”</p>
          <p>“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in
            deformity and wickedness.</p>
          <p>“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my
            condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can
            make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator,
            but I am your master;—obey!”</p>
          <p>“The hour of my <app id="var902" type="sub">

                            </app> is past, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_408" n="135"/>and the period
            of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
            they confirm me in a <app id="var903" type="sub">
                                <rdg>determination</rdg>
                            </app> of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I, in
            cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon, whose delight is in death and
            <app id="var904" type="int">

          <p>The monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of
            anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his
            mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation
            and scorn. <app id="var905" type="int">

                            </app> hours will pass in dread and misery, and
            soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to
            be happy, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_409" n="136"/>while I grovel in the intensity of my
            wretchedness? You can blast my other passions; but revenge remains—revenge, henceforth
            dearer than light or food! I may die; but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall
            curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore
            powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.
            Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.”</p>
          <p>“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared
            my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am
            inexorable.”</p>
          <p>“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.”</p>
          <p>I started forward, and exclaimed, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_410" n="137"/>“Villain! before
            you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”</p>
          <p>I would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house with <app id="var907" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy
            <app id="var908" type="int">
                                <rdg>swiftness,</rdg>
                            </app> and was soon lost amidst the waves.</p>
          <p>All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears. I burned with rage to pursue the
            murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up and down my room
            hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and
            sting me. Why had I not followed him, and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had
            suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the main land. I
            shuddered to <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_411" n="138"/>think who might be the next victim
            sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his words—“<hi rend="italic">I will be with you on your wedding-night.</hi>” That then was the period
            fixed for the <app id="var909" type="ort">
                                <rdg>fulfilment</rdg>
                            </app> of my destiny. In that hour I should die, and at once satisfy
            and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of
            my beloved Elizabeth,—of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so
            barbarously snatched from her,—tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed
            from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.</p>
          <p>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if
            it may be called calmness, when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I
            left the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_412" n="139"/>house, the horrid scene of the last night’s
            contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an
            insuperable barrier between me and my fellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should
            prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock,
            <app id="var910" type="ide">

            was to be sacrificed, or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon
            whom I had myself created.</p>
          <p>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved, and
            miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on
            the grass, and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the
            preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_413" n="140"/>inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me; and
            when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I
            began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the
            fiend rung in my ears like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and
            oppressive as a reality.</p>
          <p>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which
            had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a <app id="var911" type="ort">

            had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils, the sight of
            which was sickening to me. The next morning, at <app id="var919" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> I summoned sufficient
            courage, and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished
            creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I
            had mangled the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_415" n="142"/>living flesh of a human being. I
            paused to collect myself, and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed
            the instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of
            my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the <app id="var920" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> and I accordingly put them
            into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, <app id="var921" type="int">
                                <rdg>and,</rdg>
                            </app> laying them up, determined to throw
            them into the sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach, employed
            in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.</p>
          <p>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings
            since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded my promise with a
            gloomy despair, as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I
            now felt as if a film had been taken <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_416" n="143"/>from before my
            eyes, and that I, for the first time, saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did
            not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I
            did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own
            mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the
            basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I banished from my mind every thought that
            could lead to a different conclusion.</p>
          <p>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket
            aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was
            perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from
            them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with
            shuddering <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_417" n="144"/>anxiety any encounter with my
            fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly
            overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my
            basket into the <app id="var922" type="int">

                            </app> I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away
            from the spot. The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the
            north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with such
            agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the <app id="var923" type="int">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> fixing the
            rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
            moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut
            through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_418" n="145"/>I do not know how long I remained in this situation,
            but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was
            high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that
            the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had
            embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found <app id="var924" type="int">

            was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no
            compass with me, and was so <app id="var927" type="sub">

            immeasurable <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_419" n="146"/>waters that roared and buffeted around
            me. I had already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a
            prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
            that flew before the <app id="var929" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of
            Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; <app id="var930" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> into a reverie, so despairing and
            frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever,
            I shudder to reflect on it.</p>
          <p>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the
            wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became free from breakers. But these
            gave place to a heavy <app id="var931" type="int">
                                <rdg>swell:</rdg>
                            </app> I felt sick, and hardly able to hold the rudder, when
            suddenly <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_420" n="147"/>I saw a line of high land towards the
            south.</p>
          <p>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured for several
            hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and
            tears gushed from my eyes.</p>
          <p>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life
            even in the excess of <app id="var932" type="sub int">

                            </app> I constructed another sail with a part of my dress, and
            eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance; but, as
            I approached nearer, I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near
            the shore, and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of <app id="var933" type="ide">

            saw <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_421" n="148"/>issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was
            in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the <app id="var935" type="int">
                                <rdg>town,</rdg>
                            </app> as a place
            where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I
            turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I
            entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.</p>
          <p>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded
            towards the spot. They seemed <app id="var936" type="sub">

            me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have
            produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke
            English; and I therefore addressed them in that language: My good friends,” said I,
            “will you be so <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_422" n="149"/>kind as to tell me the name of this
            town, and inform me where I <app id="var937" type="sub int">

                        </p>
          <p>
                            <app id="var938" type="sub">

          <p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger; and I was
            also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.
            “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I <app id="var939" type="int">

          <p>While this strange dialogue conti<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_423" n="150"/>nued, I perceived
            the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger,
            which annoyed, and in some degree alarmed me. I <app id="var940" type="ide">

            replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they
            followed and surrounded me; when an ill-looking man approaching, tapped me on the
            shoulder, and said, “Come, Sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s, to give an account
            of yourself.”</p>
          <p>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free

          <p>“Ay, <app id="var941" type="ide">

            an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”</p>
          <p>This answer startled me; but I pre<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_424" n="151"/>sently recovered
            myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved: accordingly I followed my conductor
            in silence, and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from
            fatigue and hunger; but, being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all
            my strength, that no physical <app id="var942" type="ort">

            guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me,

            a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very
            dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as
            they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying
            a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. As he
            was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something, and fell <app id="var948" type="ort">

            lantern, they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance
            dead. Their first supposition was, that it was the corpse of some person who had been
            drowned, and was thrown on shore by the waves; but, <app id="var949" type="ort">

            of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of my brother, and felt myself
            extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to
            lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and of course
            drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.</p>
          <p>The son confirmed his father’s ac<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_428" n="155"/>count: but when
            Daniel Nugent was called, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his
            companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
            and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which
            I had just landed.</p>
          <p>A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was standing at the door of her
            cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the
            discovery of the body, when she saw a boat, with only one man in it, push off from that
            part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.</p>
          <p>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her
            house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed it; and Daniel went to the
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_429" n="156"/>town for an apothecary, but life was quite
            gone.</p>
          <p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed, that, with the
            strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had
            beaten about for many hours, and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from
            which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the
            body from another place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the shore,
            I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of <app id="var951" type="ide">

            place where I had deposited the corpse.</p>
          <p>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room
            where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_430" n="157"/>what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
            suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been
            described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to
            the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place
            during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons
            in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was
            perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.</p>
          <p>I entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to the coffin. How can I
            describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I
            reflect on that terrible <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_431" n="158"/>moment without shuddering
            and <app id="var952" type="sub int">

            dream from my memory, when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.
            I gasped for breath; and, throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous
            machinations deprived you also, my <app id="var954" type="ort">

                        </p>
          <p>The human frame could no longer support the <app id="var956" type="sub">
                                <rdg>agonies</rdg>
                            </app> that I endured, and I was carried
            out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>
          <p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death: my ravings, as I
            afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_432" n="159"/>of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants
            to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom <app id="var957" type="ort">
                                <rdg>1</rdg>

            felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony
            and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me;
            but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.</p>
          <p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into
            forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of
            their doating parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the
            bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of
            what materials was <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_433" n="160"/>I made, that I could thus resist
            so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the

          <p>But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking from a dream, in
            a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all
            the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to
            understanding: I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened, and only felt as if
            some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around, and saw the
            barred windows, and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my
            memory, and I groaned bitterly.</p>
          <p>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_434" n="161"/>She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys,
            and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often <app id="var960" type="ort">
                                <rdg>characterize</rdg>
                            </app> that
            class. The lines of her face were <app id="var961" type="int">

                            </app> and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see

                            </app> in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference;
            she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my
            <app id="var963" type="ide">

          <p>“Are you better now, <app id="var964" type="ide">

                            </app> said she.</p>
          <p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all
            true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery
            and horror.”</p>
          <p>“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the gentleman you
            murdered, I believe that <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_435" n="162"/>it were better for you if
            you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with <app id="var965" type="sub int">

            it were well if every body did the same.”</p>
          <p>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person
            just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid, and unable to reflect on all
            that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes
            doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the
            force of reality.</p>
          <p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness
            pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no
            dear hand sup<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_436" n="163"/>ported me. The physician came and
            prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was
            visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage
            of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who
            would gain his fee?</p>
          <p>These were my first reflections; but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had <app id="var969" type="ort">
                                <rdg>shown</rdg>

            extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me
            (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.
            It is true, he seldom came to see me; for, although he ardently desired to relieve the
            sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
            miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, <app id="var970" type="ide">

            guilty, and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.
            Such were my thoughts, when the door of my apartment was opened, and Mr. Kirwin entered.
            His <app id="var976" type="ort">

                            </app> expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine, and
            addressed me in French—</p>
          <p>“I fear that this place is very shock<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_438" n="165"/>ing to you; can
            I do any thing to make you more comfortable?”</p>
          <p>“I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole earth there is no
            comfort which I am capable of receiving.”</p>
          <p>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down
            as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy
            abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal
            charge.”</p>
          <p>“That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become the most
            miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any
            evil to me?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and <app id="var977" type="ide">

          <p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of
            my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess
            concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr.

                            </app> the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted
            into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery, and taunt me with the
            death of Clerval, as <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_441" n="168"/>a new incitement for me to
            comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in
            agony—</p>
          <p>“Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter!”</p>
          <p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my
            exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in rather a severe tone—</p>
          <p>“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been
            welcome, instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”</p>

          <p>My change of manner surprised and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_442" n="169"/>pleased the
            magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of
            delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose, and quitted the
            room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.</p>
          <p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my
            father. I stretched out my hand to him, and cried—</p>
          <p>“Are you then <app id="var988" type="sub">

          <p>My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare, and endeavoured, by dwelling on
            these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon
            felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you
            inhabit, my son!’” said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows, and wretched <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_443" n="170"/>appearance of the room. “You travelled to seek
            happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”</p>
          <p>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured
            in my weak state; I shed tears.</p>
          <p>“Alas! yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over
            me, and I must live to <app id="var989" type="ort">

            the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually
            recovered my health. <comment text=" RM edited to here 05/09/2017 "/>

                            </app> could dissipate. The image of Clerval was for ever
            before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these
            reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! why did they
            preserve so miserable and detested a life? It was surely that I might <app id="var993" type="ort">
                                <rdg>fulfil</rdg>

            throbbings, and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust;
            and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance
            of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat
            for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_445" n="172"/>bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.</p>
          <p>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison; and
            although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel
            nearly a hundred miles to the county-town, where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged
            himself with every care of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared
            the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the
            court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being
            proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was <app id="var995" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> and
            a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.</p>
          <p>My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a cri<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_446" n="173"/>minal charge, that I was again <app id="var996" type="ide">

                            </app> to breathe the
            fresh atmosphere, and allowed to return to my native country. I did not participate in
            these feelings; for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup
            of life was poisoned for ever; and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and
            gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
            no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they were the
            expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the
            lids, and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the <app id="var997" type="int">
                                <rdg>watery,</rdg>
                            </app> clouded
            eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.</p>
          <p>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_447" n="174"/>Geneva, which I should soon visit—of <app id="var998" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> and
            Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish
            for happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved cousin; or longed,
            with a devouring <hi rend="italic">maladie du pays</hi>, to see once more the blue lake
            and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood: but my general state of
            feeling was a torpor, in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene
            in nature; and these fits were seldom <app id="var999" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>interrupted,</seg>

                            </app> but by paroxysms of anguish and
            despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed;
            and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some
            dreadful act of violence.</p>
          <p>
                            <anchor id="struct51a" subtype="ide"/>I remember, as I quitted the prison, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_448" n="175"/>I heard one of
            the men say, “He may be innocent of the murder, <app id="var1362" type="ort">
                                <rdg>b«t</rdg>
                            </app> he has certainly a bad conscience.”
            These words struck me. A bad conscience! yes, surely I had one. William, Justine, and
            Clerval, had died through my infernal <app id="var1363" type="int">
                                <rdg>machinations.</rdg>
                            </app> “And whose death,” cried I, “is to
            finish the tragedy? Ah! my father, do not remain <app id="var1364" type="ort">

          <p>My father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having taken leave of Mr. Kirwin, we
            hastened to Dublin. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy weight, when the packet
            sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted for ever the country which had
            been to me the scene of so much misery.<anchor id="struct51b" subtype="ide"/>

            that I was deceived by no vision, and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had

            to embark for Havre. I preferred this plan principally because I dreaded to see again
            those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved
            Clerval. I thought with horror of seeing again those persons whom we had been accustomed
            to visit together, and who might <app id="var1365" type="ort">

          <p>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I
            thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he
            appeared to consider it as <app id="var1021" type="sub">

          <p>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, <app id="var1030" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>“What do you

                            </app> My dear son, I entreat you
            never to make such an assertion again.”</p>
          <p>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
            operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent
            victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood,
            drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
            sacrifice the whole human race.”</p>
          <p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he
            instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and <app id="var1031" type="ort">

            suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.</p>
          <p>As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no
            longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the
            consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence, I curbed the imperious voice of
            wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my
            manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the

            even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,
            tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your

            you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation that I
            had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we
            meet.</p>
          <p>“Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really

            I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to
            express to you, but have never had the courage to begin.</p>
          <p>“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_459" n="186"/>your parents ever since our <app id="var1039" type="sub">

            valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often
            entertain a lively affection towards each other, without desiring a more intimate union,
            may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you, by our

          <p>“Geneva, May 18th, 17—.”</p>
          <p>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_462" n="189"/>of the fiend—“<hi rend="italic">I will be with you on

                            </app> Such was my sentence, and on that night would the dæmon
            employ every art to destroy me, and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised
            partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his
            crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place,
            in which if he <app id="var1050" type="ort">

            end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! what freedom? such as the
            peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt,
            his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, <app id="var1051" type="ide">

            Such would be my liberty, except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure; alas!
            balanced <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_463" n="190"/>by those horrors of remorse and guilt, which
            would pursue me until death.</p>
          <p>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-read her letter, and some softened feelings
            stole into my heart, and dared to whisper <app id="var1052" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I
            would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable;
            yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten <app id="var1053" type="sub">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>fate.</seg>

                            </app> My destruction might
            indeed arrive a few months sooner; but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed
            it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other, and perhaps more dreadful
            means of revenge. He had vowed <hi rend="italic">to be with me on my wedding-night</hi>,
            yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_464" n="191"/>the <app id="var1054" type="sub int">

                            </app> I resolved,
            therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
            father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single
            hour.</p>
          <p>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I
            fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that
            I may one day enjoy is <app id="var1058" type="sub">
                                <rdg>centred</rdg>
                            </app> in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I
            consecrate my life, and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
            dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far
            from being <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_465" n="192"/>surprised at my misery, you will only
            wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror
            to you the day after our marriage shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be
            perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude
            to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”</p>
          <p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to Geneva. <app id="var1059" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>My

                            </app> welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes, as she beheld my
            emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner, and
            had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness,
            and soft looks of compassion, made her a more fit companion for one blasted and
            miserable as I was.</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_466" n="193"/>The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.
            Memory brought madness with it; and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity
            possessed me; sometimes I was furious, and burnt with <app id="var1060" type="int">
                                <rdg>rage,</rdg>
                            </app> sometimes low and
            despondent. I neither <app id="var1061" type="sub">
                                <rdg>spoke, nor looked at any one,</rdg>
                            </app> but sat motionless, bewildered by
            the multitude of miseries that overcame me.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe
            me when transported by passion, and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
            She wept with me, and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour
            to inspire me with resignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but
            for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_467" n="194"/>otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of
            grief.</p>
          <p>Soon after my <app id="var1062" type="int">
                                <rdg>arrival,</rdg>
                            </app> my father spoke of my immediate marriage with <app id="var1063" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>my cousin.</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> I
            remained silent.</p>
          <p>“Have you, then, some other attachment?”</p>
          <p>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with delight. Let the
            day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the
            happiness of my cousin.”</p>
          <p>“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen <app id="var1064" type="int">
                                <rdg>us,</rdg>
                            </app> but let us only
            cling closer to what remains, and transfer our love for those whom we have <app id="var1065" type="ide">
                                <rdg>
                                    <seg>lost</seg>
                                </rdg>
                            </app> to those
            who yet live. Our circle will be small, but bound close by the ties of affection and
            mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_468" n="195"/>and dear objects of care will be born to replace those
            of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.”</p>
          <p>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned:
            nor can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I
            <app id="var1066" type="ort">
                                <rdg>shouid</rdg>
                            </app> almost regard him as invincible; and that when he had pronounced the words, “<hi rend="italic">I shall be with you on your wedding-night</hi>,” I should regard the
            threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me, if the loss of Elizabeth
            were balanced with it; and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance,
            agreed with my father, that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place
            in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.</p>
          <p>Great God! if for one instant I <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_469" n="196"/>had thought what
            might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished
            myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over the
            earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic
            powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I
            <app id="var1067" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                                </rdg>
                            </app> only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.</p>
          <p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic
            feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of
            hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly
            deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union
            with placid contentment, not <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_470" n="197"/>unmingled with a little
            fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible
            happiness, might soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but deep and
            everlasting regret.</p>
          <p>Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were received; and all wore
            a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that
            preyed there, and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although
            they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. <app id="var1068" type="int">

            my person, in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
            constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by these means
            gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat
            appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the
            happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day

          <p>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.
            We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we were <app id="var1085" type="ort">

                            </app> and the
            assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting
            the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that
            would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who
            should wish to enslave it.</p>
          <p>I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! if you knew what I have
            suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the <app id="var1088" type="int">
                                <rdg>quiet</rdg>

            freedom from despair, that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.”</p>
          <p>“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; there is, I hope, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_474" n="201"/>nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a
            lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me
            not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us; but I will not listen
            to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along, and how the <app id="var1089" type="ide">

            the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a
            divine day! how happy and serene all nature appears!”</p>
          <p>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon
            melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her
            eyes, but it <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_475" n="202"/>continually gave place to distraction
            and reverie.</p>
          <p>The sun <app id="var1092" type="ide">

            through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come
            closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its
            eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the
            range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.</p>
          <p>The wind, which had hitherto <app id="var1093" type="ort">

            light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water, and caused a pleasant motion among
            the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of
            flowers and hay. The sun sunk be<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_476" n="203"/>neath the horizon as
            we landed; and as I touched the shore, I felt those cares and fears revive, which soon
            were to clasp me, and cling to me for ever.</p>

          <p>It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying
            the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and contemplated the lovely scene of
            waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black
            outlines.</p>
          <p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The
            moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to descend; the clouds
            swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_478" n="205"/>the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens,
            rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a
            heavy storm of rain descended.</p>
          <p>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a
            thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped
            a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I
            would sell my life dearly, and not <app id="var1095" type="sub">

            situation of my enemy.</p>
          <p>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house,
            and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I
            discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance
            had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill
            and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_480" n="207"/>had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into
            my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could
            feel the blood trickling in my veins, and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This
            state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the
            room.</p>
          <p>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the
            best hope, and the purest creature of <app id="var1103" type="ide">

            thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and her pale and distorted features half
            covered by her hair. Every where I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and
            relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live?
            Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_481" n="208"/>is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I <app id="var1104" type="ide">

          <p>When I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
            countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared only as a
            mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room
            where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.
            She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she
            lay, her head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might
            have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the
            <app id="var1105" type="ort">
                                <rdg>deadly</rdg>

            ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_482" n="208"/>murderous mark of the <app id="var1107" type="ort">

            ceased to issue from her lips.</p>
          <p>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows
            of the room had before been <app id="var1108" type="int">

                            </app> and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale
            yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and,
            with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the
            most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as
            with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the
            window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, <app id="var1109" type="ide">

                            </app> my misfortunes, and their cause. I was
            bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of
            Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not
            that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even
            now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea
            made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to
            Geneva with all possible speed.</p>
          <p>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was
            unfavourable, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_485" n="212"/>the rain fell in torrents. However,
            it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to
            row, and took an oar <app id="var1122" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in
            bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that
            I endured, rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; <app id="var1123" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> leaning my
            head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw the
            scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had contemplated but
            the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears
            streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the
            waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_486" n="213"/>by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind
            as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine, or the clouds might <app id="var1124" type="ide">

                            </app> but nothing
            could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every
            hope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful
            an event is single in the history of man.</p>
          <p>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming <app id="var1125" type="ide">

            Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their <hi rend="italic">acme</hi>, and
            what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were
            snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a
            few words, what remains of my hideous narration.</p>
          <p>I arrived at Geneva. My father and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_487" n="214"/>Ernest yet <app id="var1126" type="sub int">

            that were accumulated around him; <app id="var1130" type="ide">

            died in my arms.</p>
          <p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the
            only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in
            flowery <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_488" n="215"/>meadows and pleasant vales with the friends
            of my youth; but <app id="var1132" type="sub">

            degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was then released
            from my prison. For they had called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a
            solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>

                            </app> had I not, as I awakened to reason,
            at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me,
            I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable <app id="var1136" type="ort">
                                <rdg>dæmon</rdg>

            whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening
            rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_489" n="216"/>within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on
            his cursed head.</p>
          <p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best
            means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired
            to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I
            knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority
            for the apprehension of the murderer.</p>
          <p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and <app id="var1137" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            “ no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.”</p>
          <p>“I thank you,” replied I; “ listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make.
            It is indeed a tale so strange, that I should fear you would not credit <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_490" n="217"/>it, were there not something in truth which, however
            wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and
            I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but
            calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and
            this purpose quieted my agony, and <app id="var1138" type="sub">
                                <rdg>for an interval</rdg>

          <p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became
            more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a
            lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.</p>

          <p>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my <app id="var1142" type="ide">

            afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have
            powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_492" n="219"/>Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and

          <p>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed
            taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of

          <p>“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no
            moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring

          <p>My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.
            I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it

            and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself
            with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_496" n="223"/>a sum of money, together with a few jewels which
            had belonged to my mother, and departed.</p>

            portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which travellers, in deserts
            and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times
            have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But
            revenge kept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.</p>
          <p>When I quitted Geneva, my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the
            steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled; and I wandered many hours <app id="var1158" type="ort">
                                <rdg>round</rdg>

            the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_497" n="224"/>approached, I found myself at the entrance of the
            cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my <app id="var1159" type="ide">

            the tomb which marked their graves. Every thing was silent, except the leaves of the
            trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and the scene
            would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of
            the departed seemed to flit around, and to cast a shadow, which was felt but <app id="var1160" type="sub int">
                                <rdg>not seen,</rdg>

            around the head of the mourner.</p>
          <p>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and
            despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I
            must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass, and kissed the earth, and with
              quiver<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_498" n="225"/>ing lips exclaimed, “By the sacred earth on

            this purpose I will preserve my life: to execute this dear revenge, will I again behold
            the sun, and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
            eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead; and on you, wandering ministers
            of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink
            deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.”</p>
          <p>I had begun my <app id="var1164" type="ort">

            my utterance.</p>
          <p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rung on
            my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell
            surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been
            possessed by <app id="var1166" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

            heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died <app id="var1167" type="int">
                                <rdg>away;</rdg>
                            </app> when a well-known
            and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—“I am
            satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”</p>
          <p>
                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_500" n="227"/>I darted towards the spot from which the sound
            proceeded; but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and
            shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal
            speed.</p>
          <p>I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I
            followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared; and, by
            a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for
            the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.</p>
          <p>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever
            followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition,
            informed me of his <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_501" n="228"/>path; sometimes he himself, who
            feared that if I lost all trace <app id="var1168" type="sub">

            guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the
            white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how
            can you understand what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the
            least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried
            about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my

            insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the
            exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited me.

            invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by
            thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and

            these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other
            places human beings were seldom seen; and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that
            crossed my path. I had money with me, and gained the friendship of the villagers by
            distributing <app id="var1175" type="int">

                            <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_503" n="230"/>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to
            me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when
            most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits
            that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness, that I might
            retain strength to <app id="var1177" type="ort">

            benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my <app id="var1178" type="ort">

            beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I
            persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come, and that I should then
            enjoy reality in <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_504" n="231"/>the arms of my dearest friends. What

            most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their
            hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
            procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.</p>
          <p>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription
            that he left was in these <app id="var1189" type="ide">

          <p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to
            fail in my purpose; and, calling on <app id="var1191" type="ort">
                                <rdg>Heaven</rdg>
                            </app> to support me, I continued with unabated
            fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean ap<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_507" n="234"/>peared at a distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how unlike it
            was to the blue seas of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished
            from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they
            beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of
            their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a full heart, thanked my
            guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding
            my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.</p>
          <p>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs, and thus traversed the
            snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend possessed the same
            advantages; but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now
            gained on <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_507" n="235"/>

                            </app> so much so, that when I first saw the

            should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days
            arrived at a wretched hamlet on the sea-shore. I <app id="var1194" type="ide">
                                <rdg>

                            </app> of the inhabitants concerning
            the fiend, and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived
            the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols; putting to flight the inhabitants
            of a solitary cottage, through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their
            store of winter food, and, placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
            numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of
            the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_509" n="236"/>that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must
            speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen by the eternal frosts.</p>
          <p>On hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had escaped
            me; and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous
            ices <app id="var1195" type="sub int">

            I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea
            that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and, like
            a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the
            spirits of the dead hovered round, and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for
            my journey.</p>

            nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could
            have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my
            passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my
            destruction. But again the frost came, and made the paths of the sea secure.</p>
          <p>By the quantity of provision which I had <app id="var1198" type="int">

            and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon

                            </app> I strained my sight to discover what it could be, and

            oppressed me, I wept aloud.</p>
          <p>But this was not the time for <app id="var1208" type="int">
                                <rdg>delay:</rdg>
                            </app> I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion,
            gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely
            necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge
            was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a
            short time some <app id="var1209" type="sub">

            gained on it; and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more
            than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.</p>
          <p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my <app id="var1210" type="ide">

                            </app> my hopes were suddenly
            extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_513" n="240"/>ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder
            of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more
            ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as
            with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with a tremendous and
            overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled
            between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was
            continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.</p>
          <p>In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died; and I myself was
            about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I saw your vessel riding at
            anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. I had no conception that
            vessels <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_514" n="241"/>ever came so far north, and was astounded at
            the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars; and by these means
            was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction of your ship. I
            had determined, if you were <app id="var1211" type="int">

            I could pursue my enemy. But your direction was northward. You took me on board when my
            vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a

          Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice
          broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with <app id="var1223" type="ide">

          and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and
          quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones, and
          related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of
            agi<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_517" n="244"/>tation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his
          face would suddenly change to an <app id="var1224" type="ort">

          imprecations on his persecutor.</p>
        <p>His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the simplest truth; yet I own to
          you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he <app id="var1225" type="ort">

                        </app> I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I

        <p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them,
          and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but principally in giving
          the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved
          my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
          posterity.”</p>
        <p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever
          imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up by the
          interest for my guest, which this tale, and his own <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_518" n="246"/>elevated and gentle <app id="var1231" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

          infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only
          joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered <app id="var1232" type="sub">

                        </app> to peace and death.
          Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes, that, when
          in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that communion consolation
          for his miseries, or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
          fancy, but the <app id="var1233" type="sub">

          faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and
          interesting as truth.</p>
        <p>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and mis<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_520" n="247"/>fortunes. On every point of general literature he
          displays unbounded knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is
          forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when <app id="var1234" type="ort">

                        </app> He seems to feel his own worth, and the greatness of his fall.</p>
        <p>“When younger,” said he, “ I <app id="var1236" type="sub">

                        </app> destined for some great enterprise. My
          feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for
          illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me, when
          others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_521" n="248"/>
                        <app id="var1237" type="int">

                        </app> those talents that might be useful to my
          fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the
          creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of
          common projectors. But this <app id="var1238" type="sub">

                        </app> which supported me in the commencement of my career,
          now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as
          nothing; and, like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal
          hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by
          the union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a man.
          Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. <app id="var1239" type="sub">

          hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I
          once was, you would not <app id="var1241" type="ide">

          visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to
          rise.”</p>
        <p>Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who

          but, I fear, I have gained him only to know his value, and lose him. I would reconcile him
          to life, but he repulses the idea.</p>
        <p>“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions <app id="var1243" type="int">

          but when you speak of new ties, and fresh affections, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_523" n="250"/>think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was;
          or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any
          superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over
          our minds, which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions,

          of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister

          design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil
          it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave
          existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled, and I may die.”</p>

        <p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly probable
          that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.</p>
        <p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in
          their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already
          found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health:
          a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused
          to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.</p>
        <p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat
          watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_528" n="255"/>half
          closed, and his limbs hanging listlessly,—I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who
          <app id="var1262" type="sub">
                            <rdg>demanded</rdg>
                        </app> admission into the cabin. They <app id="var1263" type="int">
                            <rdg>entered,</rdg>
                        </app> and their leader addressed me. He told me
          that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to
          me, to make me a <app id="var1264" type="sub">
                            <rdg>requisition,</rdg>
                        </app> which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in
          ice, and should probably never escape; but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice
          should dissipate, and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my
          voyage, and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.
          They <app id="var1265" type="sub">
                            <rdg>insisted,</rdg>
                        </app> therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise, that if the vessel
          should be <app id="var1266" type="int">
                            <rdg>freed</rdg>
                        </app> I would instantly direct my course southward.</p>
        <p>This speech troubled me. I had <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_529" n="256"/>not despaired; nor had
          I yet <app id="var1267" type="ort">
                            <rdg>conceited</rdg>
                        </app> the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in
          possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein, who had
          at first been silent, <app id="var1268" type="int">
                            <rdg>and,</rdg>
                        </app> indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now
          roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning
          towards the men, he said—</p>
        <p>“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so easily turned from
          your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? <app id="var1269" type="ort">
                            <rdg>and</rdg>
                        </app> wherefore was it glorious?
          Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of
          dangers and terror; because, at every new incident, your fortitude was to be called forth,
          and your courage exhibited; because <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_530" n="257"/>danger and death

                        </app> and these <app id="var1271" type="sub">
                            <rdg>

                        </app> were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this
          was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of
          your species; your <app id="var1272" type="ort">
                            <rdg>names</rdg>
                        </app> adored, as belonging to brave men who encountered death for

                        </app> and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger,
          or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away, and
          are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril;
          and so, poor souls, they were chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why, that
          requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far, and dragged your captain to
          the shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! be men, or <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_531" n="258"/>be more than men. Be steady to your purposes, and firm as
          a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts <app id="var1274" type="sub">

          and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”</p>
        <p>He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his
          speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these
          men were <app id="var1277" type="ide">

                        </app> They looked at one another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them
          to retire, and consider of what had been said: that I would not lead them <app id="var1278" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

          if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_532" n="259"/>that, with reflection, their courage would return.</p>
        <p>They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in languor, and almost
          deprived of life.</p>
        <p>How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather <app id="var1279" type="ide">

          purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of
          glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present <app id="var1280" type="ort">

                    </p>
        <p>September 7th.</p>
        <p>The die is cast; I have consented to return, if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes
          blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed. It requires
          more philosophy than I possess, to bear this injustice with patience.</p>
        <p>
                        <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_533" n="260"/>September <app id="var1281" type="int">
                            <rdg>12th</rdg>
                        </app>
                    </p>
        <p>It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory;—I have
          lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear
          sister; and, while I am wafted towards England, and towards you, I will not despond.</p>
        <p>September <app id="var1282" type="ort">
                            <rdg>9th,</rdg>
                        </app> the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance,
          as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the most imminent peril;
          but, as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate
          guest, whose illness increased in such a degree, that he was entirely confined to his bed.
          The ice cracked behind us, and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprung
          from the west, and on the 11th <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_534" n="261"/>the passage towards the
          south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and that their return to their
          native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and
          long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke, and asked the cause of the tumult.
          “They shout,” I said, “because they will soon return to England.”</p>
        <p>“Do you then really return?”</p>
        <p>“Alas! <app id="var1283" type="sub int">
                            <rdg>yes ;</rdg>
                        </app> I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger,
          and I must return.”</p>
        <p>“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your <app id="var1284" type="int">
                            <rdg>purpose;</rdg>
                        </app> but mine is assigned
          to me by <app id="var1285" type="ort">
                            <rdg>Heaven,</rdg>
                        </app> and I dare not. I am weak; but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance
          will endow me with sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
          bed, but the exertion was <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_535" n="262"/>too great for him; he fell
          back, and fainted.</p>
        <p>It was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was entirely extinct.
          At length he opened his <app id="var1286" type="sub int">
                            <rdg>eyes;</rdg>
                        </app> he breathed with difficulty, and was unable to speak. The
          surgeon gave him a composing draught, and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the mean
          time he told me, that my friend had <app id="var1287" type="sub">
                            <rdg>certainly <seg>not</seg>
                            </rdg>
                        </app> many hours to live.</p>
        <p>His sentence was <app id="var1288" type="int">
                            <rdg>pronounced;</rdg>
                        </app> and I could only grieve, and be patient. I sat by his <app id="var1289" type="int">
                            <rdg>bed,</rdg>
                        </app>
          watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me
          in a feeble voice, and, bidding me come near, <app id="var1290" type="sub int">
                            <rdg>said— “Alas!</rdg>
                        </app> the strength I relied on is
          gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in
          being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_536" n="263"/>burning hatred, and ardent desire of <app id="var1291" type="int">
                            <rdg>revenge,</rdg>
                        </app> I once
          expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these
          last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it <app id="var1292" type="ide">
                            <rdg>
                                <seg>blameable.</seg>

                        </app>
          In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature, and was bound towards him,
          to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty; but
          there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards <app id="var1293" type="sub">
                            <rdg>the beings of <seg>my</seg> own species</rdg>
                        </app>
          had greater claims to my attention, because they included a greater proportion of
          happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create
          a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in
          evil: he destroyed my friends; <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_537" n="264"/>he devoted to
          destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I
          know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself, that he may render no
          other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.
          When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work;
          and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.</p>
        <p>“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends, to <app id="var1294" type="ort">
                            <rdg>fulfil</rdg>
                        </app> this task; and now,
          that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But
          the consideration of these points, and the <app id="var1295" type="sub">
                            <rdg>well-balancing</rdg>
                        </app> of what you may esteem your
          duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_538" n="265"/>approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think
          right, for I may still be misled by passion.</p>
        <p>“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other <app id="var1296" type="ide">
                            <rdg>

                        </app> this
          hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for
          several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.
          Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it be only
          the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why
          do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”</p>
        <p>His voice became fainter as he spoke; and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sunk
          into silence. About <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_539" n="266"/>half an hour afterwards he
          attempted again to speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed
          for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.</p>
        <p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?
          What can I <app id="var1297" type="int">
                            <rdg>say,</rdg>
                        </app> that will enable you to understand the depth of my <app id="var1298" type="sub int">
                            <rdg>sorrow ?</rdg>
                        </app> All that I
          should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a
          cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find
          consolation.</p>
        <p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly,
          and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound as of a human voice, but <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_540" n="267"/>hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of
          Frankenstein still lie. I must <app id="var1299" type="int">
                            <rdg>arise,</rdg>
                        </app> and examine. Good night, my sister.</p>
        <p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it.
          I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have
          recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.</p>
        <p>I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him
          hung a form which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and
          distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
          locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like
          that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_541" n="268"/>ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror, and sprung towards the
          window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome, yet
          appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to recollect what
          were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.</p>
        <p>He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards the lifeless form of his
          creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated
          by the wildest rage of some <app id="var1300" type="ort">
                            <rdg>uncontrolable</rdg>

        <p>“That is also my victim!” he <app id="var1301" type="int">

          I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and
          of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness; that while he accumulated

          and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a
          deadly torture; but I was the slave, not the <app id="var1314" type="int">

        <p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what
          Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my

          Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
