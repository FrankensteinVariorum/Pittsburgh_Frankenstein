      <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by
        Dr. Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of impossible
        occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to
        such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not
        considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on which the
        interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or
        enchantment. It was recommended by the novelty of the situations which it developes; and,
        however impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to the imagination for the
        delineating of human passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary
        relations of existing events can yield.</p>
      <p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature,
        while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry
        of Greece,—Shakspeare<comment elem="note" text="RM: printer error: Shakspeare"/>, in the Tempest, and Midsummer Night’s Dream,—and most especially
        Milton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule; and the most humble novelist, who seeks to
        confer or receive amusement from his labours, may, without presumption, apply to prose
        fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many exquisite
        combinations of human feeling have resulted in the highest specimens of poetry.</p>
      <p>The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual conversation. It was
        commenced partly as a source of amusement, and partly as an expedient for exercising any
        untried resources of mind. Other motives were <pb xml:id="F1831_v_018" n="2"/>mingled with
        these, as the work proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever
        moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader;
        yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects
        of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of the amiableness of domestic
        affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from
        the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always
        in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as
        prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
      <p>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story was begun in the
        majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to be
        regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva. The season was cold and
        rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and occasionally amused
        ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which happened to fall into our hands. These
        tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of
        one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can ever hope to
        produce) and myself agreed to write each a story, founded on some supernatural
        occurrence.</p>
      <p>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me on a journey among
        the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which they present, all memory of their
        ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one which has been completed.</p>
      <p>Marlow, September, 1817.</p>

        <p><anchor id="struct7a"/>St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.</p>
        <p>Y<hi rend="smallcaps">OU</hi> will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
          commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I
          arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare, and
          increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
        <p>I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a
          cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves, and fills me with
          delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions
          towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this
          wind of promise, my day dreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be
          persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my
          imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
          visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
          There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a
          land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
          globe. Its productions and features may be without ex<pb xml:id="F1831_v_020" n="4"/>ample, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
          solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover
          the wondrous power which attracts the needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial
          observations, that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities
          consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the
          world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of
          man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or
          death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when
          he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
          native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the
          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by
          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many
          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all
          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
        <p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel
          my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes so
          much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its
          intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have
          read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect
          of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may
          remember, that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
          whole of our good uncle Thomas’s library. My education was neglected, yet I was
          passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my
          familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that
          my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring
          life.</p>
        <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions
          entranced my soul, and lifted <pb xml:id="F1831_v_021" n="5"/>it to heaven. I also became a
          poet, and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also
          might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakspeare are
          consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I bore the
          disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
          thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>
        <p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now,
          remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by
          inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the
          North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked
          harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to the study of
          mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a
          naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired
          myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must
          own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel,
          and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so valuable did he consider my
          services.</p>
        <p>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might
          have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth
          placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My
          courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often
          depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
          will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but
          sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.</p>
        <p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the
          snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than
          that of an English stage-coach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs,—a
          dress which I have <pb xml:id="F1831_v_022" n="6"/>already adopted; for there is a great
          difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no
          exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to
          lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.</p>
        <p>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to
          hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to
          engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the
          whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of June: and when shall I return?
          Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps
          years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or
          never.<anchor id="struct7b"/></p>

        <p><anchor id="struct11a"/>Archangel, 28th March, 17—.</p>
        <p>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! yet a second step
          is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my
          sailors; those whom I have already engaged, appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are
          certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</p>
        <p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the absence of the
          object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret: when I am
          glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am
          assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall
          commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication
          of <pb xml:id="F1831_v_023" n="7"/>feeling. I desire the company of a man who could
          sympathise with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear
          sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
          courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are
          like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of
          your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of difficulties. But it
          is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my
          life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas’s books of voyages. At
          that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only
          when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a
          conviction, that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than
          that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate than
          many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more, and that my day dreams
          are more extended and magnificent; but they want (as the painters call it) <hi rend="italic">keeping;</hi> and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not
          to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my
          mind.</p>
        <p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean,
          nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the
          dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a
          man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory: or rather, to word
          my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman,
          and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation,
          retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on
          board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to
          assist in my enterprise.</p>
        <p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in the ship for his
          gentleness and the mild<pb xml:id="F1831_v_024" n="8"/>ness of his discipline. This
          circumstance, added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very
          desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle
          and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character, that I cannot
          overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never
          believed it to be necessary; and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his
          kindliness of heart, and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself
          peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather
          a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly,
          is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and
          having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the
          match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears,
          and, throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time
          that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to
          the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name
          of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his
          money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the
          whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and
          then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.
          But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend; who,
          when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that
          his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you
          will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a
          kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more
          astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.</p>
        <p>Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a consolation
          for my toils which I <pb xml:id="F1831_v_025" n="9"/>may never know, that I am wavering in
          my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is only now delayed until the
          weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring
          promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season; so that perhaps I may
          sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to
          confide in my prudence and considerateness, whenever the safety of others is committed to
          my care.</p>
        <p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is
          impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable
          and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions,
          to “the land of mist and snow;” but I shall kill no albatross, therefore do not be alarmed
          for my safety, or if I should come back to you as worn and woful as the “Ancient Mariner?”
          You will smile at my allusion; but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my
          attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of the ocean, to that
          production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul,
          which I do not understand. I am practically industrious—pains-taking;—a workman to
          execute with perseverance and labour:—but besides this, there is a love for the
          marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me
          out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about
          to explore. </p>
        <p>But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed
          immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not
          expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for
          the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some
          occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember
          me with affection, should you never hear from me again.</p>

        <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">WRITE</hi> a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well
          advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward
          voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for
          many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold, and apparently firm of
          purpose; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the
          dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have
          already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so
          warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which
          I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
          expected.</p>
        <p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two
          stiff gales, and the springing of a leak, are accidents which experienced navigators
          scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us
          during our voyage.</p>
        <p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not
          rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.</p>
        <p>But success <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I
          have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas: the very stars themselves being
          witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet
          obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?</p>
        <p>My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my

        <p><anchor id="struct15a"/>August 5th, 17—.</p>
        <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although
          it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your
          possession.</p>
        <p>Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on
          all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was
          somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We
          accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and
          weather.</p>
        <p>About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction,
          vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades
          groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange
          sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own
          situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on
          towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man,
          but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the
          rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
          inequalities of the ice.</p>
        <p>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred
          miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so
          distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his
          track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.</p>
        <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice
          broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to <pb xml:id="F1831_v_028" n="12"/>encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float
          about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few
          hours.</p>
        <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the
          sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to some one in the sea. It was,
          in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the
          night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
          being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the
          other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but an
          European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not
          allow you to perish on the open sea.”</p>
        <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.
          “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me
          whither you are bound?”</p>
        <p>You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on
          the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have
          been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth
          can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern
          pole.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
          Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would
          have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by
          fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry
          him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We
          accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to animation by rubbing him
          with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of
          life we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.
          By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1831_v_029" n="13"/>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to
          speak; and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he
          had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much
          as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally
          an expression of wildness, and even madness; but there are moments when, if any one
          performs an act of kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his
          whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that
          I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he
          gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
        <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished
          to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle
          curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire
          repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so
          strange a vehicle?</p>
        <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he replied, “To
          seek one who fled from me.”<anchor id="struct15b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct16a"/><app id="var8"><lem>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in</lem></app> the <app id="var9"><lem>same fashion?”</lem></app><anchor id="struct16b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct17a"/>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Then I fancy we have seen him; for the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs
          drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”</p>
        <p>This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning
          the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone
          with me, he said,—“I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these
          good people; but you are too considerate to make enquiries.”</p>
        <p>“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
          inquisitiveness of mine.”<anchor id="struct17b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct18a"/><pb xml:id="F1831_v_030" n="14"/><app id="var10"><lem>“And yet you rescued me from a strange</lem></app> and <app id="var11"><lem>perilous
          situation; you have benevolently</lem></app> restored me to <app id="var12"><lem>life.”</lem></app><anchor id="struct18b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct19a"/>Soon after this he enquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed
          the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the
          ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of
          safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>
        <p>From this time the a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He
          manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge which had
          before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak
          to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that some one should watch for
          him, and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.</p>
        <p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The
          stranger has gradually improved in health, but is very silent, and appears uneasy when any
          one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that
          the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication
          with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant and deep
          grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his
          better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.</p>
        <p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide
          ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should
          have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.</p>
        <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
          incidents to record.</p><anchor xml:id="C06"/>
        <p>August 13th, 17—.</p>
        <p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my
          pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery,
          without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so <pb xml:id="F1831_v_031" n="15"/>gentle,
          yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words are culled
          with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.</p>
        <p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently
          watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly
          occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of
          others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him
          without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual
          success, and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was
          easily led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give
          utterance to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed
          me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the
          furtherance of my enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for
          the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought; for the dominion I should acquire and
          transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my
          listener’s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he
          placed his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered and failed me, as I beheld tears
          trickle fast from between his fingers,—a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused;
         —at length he spoke, in broken accents:—“Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you
          drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my tale, and you will
          dash the cup from your lips!”</p>
        <p>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief
          that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and
          tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.</p>
        <p>Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being
          the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to
          converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The
          tale was quickly told: <pb xml:id="F1831_v_032" n="16"/>but it awakened various trains of
          reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend—of my thirst for a more intimate
          sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction
          that a man could boast of little happiness, who did not enjoy this blessing.</p>
        <p>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made
          up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend
          his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble
          of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have
          hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost every
          thing, and cannot begin life anew.”</p>
        <p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched
          me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.</p>
        <p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of
          nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions,
          seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double
          existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has
          retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo around him,
          within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p>
        <p>Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You would
          not, if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the
          world, and you are, therefore, somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit
          to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured
          to discover what quality it is which he possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above
          any other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but
          never-failing power of judgment; a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for
          clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression, and a voice whose varied
          intonations are soul-subduing music.<anchor id="struct19b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct20a"/><pb xml:id="F1831_v_033" n="17"/>August 19. 17—.<anchor id="struct20b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct21a"/>Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have
          suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, at one time, that the
          memory of these evils should die with me; but you have won me to alter my determination.
          You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the
          gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not
          know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you
          are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
          what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may direct
          you if you succeed in your undertaking, and console you in case of failure. Prepare to
          hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of
          nature, I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
          will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions, which would provoke the
          laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature:—nor can I doubt
          but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of
          which it is composed.”</p>
        <p>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I
          could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt
          the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly
          from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these
          feelings in my answer.</p>
        <p>“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly
          fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your
          feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken,
          my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to
          my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.”</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1831_v_034" n="18"/>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative
          the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I
          have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as
          nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be
          engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the
          greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what
          interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my task,
          his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their
          melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his
          face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story; frightful
          the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it—thus!</p>

        <div type="chapter">
          <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
          <p> I <hi rend="smallcaps">AM</hi> by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most
            distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
            syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
            He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity and indefatigable attention to
            public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his
            country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until
            the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.</p>
          <p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
            relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing
            state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was
            Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
            poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
            his rank and magni<pb xml:id="F1831_v_035" n="19"/>ficence. Having paid his debts,
            therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of
            Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the
            truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
            circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so
            little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek
            him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
            assistance.</p>
          <p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before
            my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,
            which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and
            despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the
            wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some
            months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
            merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only
            became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took
            so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness,
            incapable of any exertion.</p>
          <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that
            their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
            support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
            rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by
            various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>
          <p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely
            occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month
            her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame
            her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
            chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_036" n="20"/>poor
            girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend, he
            conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years
            after this event Caroline became his wife.</p>
          <p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this
            circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a
            sense of justice in my father’s upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should
            approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
            late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set a greater value
            on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my
            mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by
            reverence for her virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
            her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour
            to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to
            shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and
            to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
            benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,
            had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed
            previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public
            functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,
            and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
            as a restorative for her weakened frame.</p>
          <p>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples,
            and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their
            only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible
            stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender
            caresses, and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my first
            recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—<pb xml:id="F1831_v_037" n="21"/>their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed
            on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands
            to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.
            With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given
            life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined
            that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of
            charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but one
            train of enjoyment to me.</p>
          <p>For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter,
            but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an
            excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of
            Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This,
            to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion,—remembering what
            she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,—for her to act in her turn the
            guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of
            a vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of
            half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day,
            when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this
            abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour,
            distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which
            attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four
            others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin, and very fair. Her
            hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to
            set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes
            cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and
            sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a
            being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1831_v_038" n="22"/>The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed
            eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She
            was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German, and
            had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to
            nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child
            was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the
            memory of the antique glory of Italy,—one among the <hi rend="italic">schiavi ognor
              frementi</hi>, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the
            victim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of
            Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child became an orphan and a
            beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer
            than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.</p>
          <p>When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa,
            a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her
            looks, and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The
            apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic
            guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence
            had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and
            want, when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their
            village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my
            parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my
            occupations and my pleasures.</p>
          <p>Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which
            all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening
            previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully,—“I have a
            pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she
            presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness,
            interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect,
            love, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_039" n="23"/>cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I
            received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name
            of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she
            stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.</p>

          <p> W<hi rend="smallcaps">E</hi> were brought up together; there was not quite a year
            difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion
            or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast
            that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and
            more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
            application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied
            herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and
            wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains;
            the changes of the seasons; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and
            turbulence of our Alpine summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
            While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent
            appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a
            secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws
            of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest
            sensations I can remember.</p>
          <p>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely
            their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house
            in Geneva, and a <hi rend="italic">campagne</hi> on Belrive, the eastern shore of the
            lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally
            in the latter, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_040" n="24"/>the lives of my parents were passed
            in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself
            fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my schoolfellows in general; but I
            united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval
            was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved
            enterprise, hardship, and even danger, for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of
            chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and began to write many a tale of
            enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into
            masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the
            Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the
            holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.</p>
          <p>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were
            possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the
            tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all
            the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I distinctly
            discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the developement
            of filial love.</p>
          <p>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my
            temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager desire to
            learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the
            structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states,
            possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to
            learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit of nature
            and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the
            metaphysical, or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.
            The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his theme;
            and his hope and his dream was to become one among those <pb xml:id="F1831_v_041" n="25"/>whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our
            species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our
            peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her
            celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of
            love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the
            ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own
            gentleness. And Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet
            he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity—so full of
            kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded
            to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim of
            his soaring ambition.</p>
          <p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before
            misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness
            into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my
            early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale
            of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which
            afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and
            almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in
            its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.<anchor id="struct21b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var13"><lem>Natural</lem></app> philosophy <app id="var14"><lem>is</lem></app> the genius that has regulated my <app id="var15"><lem>fate;</lem></app> I <app id="var16"><lem>desire, therefore,</lem></app> in
            this <app id="var17"><lem>narration,</lem></app> to state those facts which led to my <app id="var18"><lem>predilection</lem></app> for that science. When
            I was <app id="var19"><lem>thirteen</lem></app> years <app id="var20"><lem>of age,</lem></app> we all went on a party of pleasure to <app id="var21"><lem>the</lem></app> baths near
            <app id="var22"><lem>Thonon: the inclemency</lem></app> of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In
            this house I chanced to <app id="var23"><lem>find</lem></app> a <app id="var24"><lem>volume</lem></app> of the <app id="var25"><lem>works</lem></app> of <app id="var26"><lem>Cornelius</lem></app> Agrippa. <app id="var27"><lem>I</lem></app> opened it

            he <app id="var33"><lem>relates,</lem></app> soon changed this feeling into <app id="var34"><lem>enthusiasm.</lem></app> A new light <app id="var35"><lem>seemed to dawn</lem></app> upon
            my <app id="var36"><lem>mind; and,</lem></app> bounding with <app id="var37"><lem>joy,</lem></app> I communicated my discovery to my father. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_042" n="26"/><app id="var38"><lem>My</lem></app> father looked carelessly at the <app id="var39"><lem>titlepage</lem></app> of my <app id="var40"><lem>book,</lem></app>
            and <app id="var41"><lem>said,</lem></app> “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! <app id="var42"><lem>My</lem></app> dear <app id="var43"><lem>Victor,</lem></app> do not waste your time upon <app id="var44"><lem>this;</lem></app> it
            is sad <app id="var45"><lem>trash.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><app id="var46"><lem>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the
            principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that</lem></app> a modern system of science
            had been <app id="var47"><lem>introduced,</lem></app> which possessed much greater <app id="var48"><lem>powers</lem></app> than the <app id="var49"><lem>ancient,</lem></app> because the
            powers of the <app id="var50"><lem>latter</lem></app> were <app id="var51"><lem>chimerical,</lem></app> while those of the <app id="var52"><lem>former were</lem></app> real and practical;
            under such <app id="var53"><lem>circumstances,</lem></app> I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and <app id="var54"><lem>have
            contented</lem></app> my <app id="var55"><lem>imagination,</lem></app> warmed as it <app id="var56"><lem>was, by returning with greater ardour</lem></app> to <app id="var57"><lem>my
            former studies.</lem></app> It is even <app id="var58"><lem>possible,</lem></app> that the train of my ideas <app id="var59"><lem>would</lem></app> never have
            <app id="var60"><lem>received the</lem></app> fatal impulse <app id="var61"><lem>that</lem></app> led <app id="var62"><lem>to</lem></app> my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had
            taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with <app id="var63"><lem>its</lem></app> contents; and
            I continued to read with the greatest <app id="var64"><lem>avidity.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct22a"/>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and
            afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of
            these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself. I
            have described myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate
            the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of
            modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir
            Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside
            the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of
            natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions,
            as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.</p>
          <p>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their
            practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled
            the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He
            might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in
            their secondary and tertiary grades were <pb xml:id="F1831_v_043" n="27"/>utterly
            unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
            human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had
            repined.<anchor id="struct22b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct23a"/> <anchor id="struct23b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var65"><lem>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took
            their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.</lem></app> It may appear <app id="var66"><lem>strange</lem></app>
            that <app id="var67"><lem>such</lem></app> should arise in the eighteenth <app id="var68"><lem>century;</lem></app> but <app id="var69"><lem>while I followed the routine</lem></app> of
            <app id="var70"><lem>education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to
            my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a
            child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my
            new preceptors,</lem></app> I entered with the <app id="var71"><lem>greatest</lem></app> diligence into the search of the
            philosopher’s stone and the <app id="var72"><lem>elixir</lem></app> of <app id="var73"><lem>life; but</lem></app> the latter <app id="var74"><lem>soon obtained</lem></app> my <app id="var75"><lem>undivided
            attention. Wealth</lem></app> was an inferior <app id="var76"><lem>object;</lem></app> but what <app id="var77"><lem>glory would attend</lem></app> the <app id="var78"><lem>discovery,</lem></app> if
            I could <app id="var79"><lem>banish</lem></app> disease from the human <app id="var80"><lem>frame,</lem></app> and render man <app id="var81"><lem>invulnerable</lem></app> to <app id="var82"><lem>any but a
            violent death!</lem></app></p>
          <p><app id="var83"><lem>Nor</lem></app> were these my only <app id="var84"><lem>visions. The</lem></app> raising of ghosts or devils <app id="var85"><lem>was a</lem></app> promise liberally
            accorded by <app id="var86"><lem>my</lem></app> favourite <app id="var87"><lem>authors,</lem></app> the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; <app id="var88"><lem>and</lem></app> if
            my incantations were always <app id="var89"><lem>unsuccessful, I attributed</lem></app> the failure rather to my own
            inexperience <app id="var90"><lem>and</lem></app> mistake, than <app id="var91"><lem>to</lem></app> a want of skill <app id="var92"><lem>or</lem></app> fidelity in my instructors. <app id="var93"><lem>And
            thus for a time</lem></app> I was <app id="var94"><lem>occupied</lem></app> <app id="var95"><lem>by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a
            thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately</lem></app> in <app id="var96"><lem>a very slough of
            multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an

          <p><app id="var98"><lem>When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we

            issue from an old <app id="var107"><lem>and</lem></app> beautiful <app id="var108"><lem>oak, which stood</lem></app> about <app id="var109"><lem>twenty</lem></app> yards from our <pb xml:id="F1831_v_044" n="28"/><app id="var110"><lem>house;</lem></app> and <app id="var111"><lem>so</lem></app> soon as the <app id="var112"><lem>dazzling</lem></app> light <app id="var113"><lem>vanished,</lem></app> the

            the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribands of wood. <app id="var120"><lem>I</lem></app> never <app id="var121"><lem>beheld anything</lem></app> so
            utterly <app id="var122"><lem>destroyed.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct26a"/>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this
            occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this
            catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the
            subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All
            that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and
            Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men
            disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or
            could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
            By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early
            youth, I at once gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its
            progeny as a deformed and abortive creation; and entertained the greatest disdain for a
            would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In
            this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study
            appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of
            my consideration.</p>
          <p>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to
            prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change
            of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—            the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then
            hanging in the stars, and ready to envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual
            tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and
            latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
            their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1831_v_045" n="29"/>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it
            was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
            terrible destruction.</p>

            resolved upon could <app id="var137"><lem>arrive,</lem></app> the first <app id="var138"><lem>misfortune</lem></app> of my life <app id="var139"><lem>occurred—an omen,</lem></app> as it

          <p><app id="var142"><lem>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the
            greatest danger. During her illness, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother
            to refrain from attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but
            when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control
            her anxiety. She attended her sick bed,—her watchful attentions triumphed over the
            malignity of the distemper,—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences</lem></app> of this
            imprudence were <app id="var143"><lem>fatal to her preserver. On</lem></app> the third day my mother <app id="var144"><lem>sickened; her</lem></app> fever
            was <app id="var145"><lem>accompanied by the most alarming symptoms,</lem></app> and the looks of her <app id="var146"><lem>medical attendants</lem></app>
            prognosticated the <app id="var147"><lem>worst event.</lem></app> On her <app id="var148"><lem>death-bed</lem></app> the <app id="var149"><lem>fortitude</lem></app> and benignity <app id="var150"><lem>of this
            best of women</lem></app> did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and <app id="var151"><lem>myself:—“My
            children,”</lem></app> she <app id="var152"><lem>said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed</lem></app> on <app id="var153"><lem>the prospect
            of your union. This expectation</lem></app> will now be the consolation of your <app id="var154"><lem>father.</lem></app> Elizabeth,
            my love, <app id="var155"><lem>you must supply</lem></app> my place to <app id="var156"><lem>my younger children.</lem></app> Alas! I <app id="var157"><lem>regret that</lem></app> I am taken
            from <app id="var158"><lem>you; and,</lem></app> happy and <app id="var159"><lem>beloved</lem></app> as I <app id="var160"><lem>have been,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1831_v_046" n="30"/>is it
            not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting <app id="var161"><lem>me;</lem></app> I <app id="var162"><lem>will</lem></app> endeavour to
            resign myself <app id="var163"><lem>cheerfully</lem></app> to <app id="var164"><lem>death,</lem></app> and will indulge a hope <app id="var165"><lem>of</lem></app> meeting you in another

          <p><app id="var167"><lem>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not
            describe the feelings of those whose</lem></app> dearest ties are rent by that most <app id="var168"><lem>irreparable</lem></app>
            evil; the <app id="var169"><lem>void</lem></app> that <app id="var170"><lem>presents</lem></app> itself to <app id="var171"><lem>the soul;</lem></app> and the despair that is exhibited on
            the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom <app id="var172"><lem>we</lem></app> saw
            every day, and whose very existence appeared a part of <app id="var173"><lem>our own,</lem></app> can have departed for
            <app id="var174"><lem>ever—that</lem></app> the brightness of a <app id="var175"><lem>beloved</lem></app> eye can have <app id="var176"><lem>been</lem></app> extinguished, and the sound of
            a voice <app id="var177"><lem>so familiar,</lem></app> and dear to the <app id="var178"><lem>ear,</lem></app> can be hushed, never more to be heard. These
            are the reflections of the first <app id="var179"><lem>days; but</lem></app> when the lapse of time proves the reality of
            the <app id="var180"><lem>evil,</lem></app> then the <app id="var181"><lem>actual</lem></app> bitterness of grief <app id="var182"><lem>commences. Yet</lem></app> from whom <app id="var183"><lem>has</lem></app> not <app id="var184"><lem>that rude
            hand</lem></app> rent away <app id="var185"><lem>some dear connection?</lem></app> and why <app id="var186"><lem>should</lem></app> I describe a sorrow which all have
            felt, and must feel? <app id="var187"><lem>The</lem></app> time at length <app id="var188"><lem>arrives,</lem></app> when grief is rather an indulgence <app id="var189"><lem>than</lem></app>
            a <app id="var190"><lem>necessity;</lem></app> and the smile that plays <app id="var191"><lem>upon</lem></app> the lips, although it <app id="var192"><lem>may be</lem></app> deemed <app id="var193"><lem>a
            sacrilege,</lem></app> is not <app id="var194"><lem>banished.</lem></app> My mother was <app id="var195"><lem>dead,</lem></app> but we had <app id="var196"><lem>still duties which we ought
            to perform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think ourselves
            fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct30a"/>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again
            determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me
            sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning, and to
            rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I
            was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above all, I desired
            to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.</p>
          <p>She indeed veiled her grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked
            steadily on life, and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to
            those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_047" n="31"/>cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine
            of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours
            to make us forget.</p>
          <p>The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He
            had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me, and to become my
            fellow student; but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and
            ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of
            being debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he spoke, I read in
            his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be
            chained to the miserable details of commerce.</p>
          <p>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves
            to say the word “Farewell!” It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking
            repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but when at morning’s dawn I
            descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father
            again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her
            entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her
            playmate and friend.<anchor id="struct30b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct31a"/> <anchor id="struct31b"/></p>
          <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me <app id="var197"><lem>away,</lem></app> and <app id="var198"><lem>indulged</lem></app> in the most
            melancholy <app id="var199"><lem>reflections. I,</lem></app> who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions,
            continually engaged in <app id="var200"><lem>endeavouring</lem></app> to <app id="var201"><lem>bestow</lem></app> mutual <app id="var202"><lem>pleasure,</lem></app> I was now alone. In the
            <app id="var203"><lem>university,</lem></app> whither I was <app id="var204"><lem>going,</lem></app> I must form my own <app id="var205"><lem>friends,</lem></app> and be my own <app id="var206"><lem>protector.</lem></app> My
            life had hitherto been remarkably <app id="var207"><lem>secluded</lem></app> and <app id="var208"><lem>domestic;</lem></app> and this had given me
            <app id="var209"><lem>invincible</lem></app> repugnance to new <app id="var210"><lem>countenances.</lem></app> I loved my <app id="var211"><lem>brothers, Elizabeth,</lem></app> and <app id="var212"><lem>Clerval;</lem></app>
            these were “old familiar <app id="var213"><lem>faces;”</lem></app> but I believed <app id="var214"><lem>myself</lem></app> totally unfitted for the <app id="var215"><lem>company</lem></app>
            of strangers. Such were my <app id="var216"><lem>reflections</lem></app> as I commenced my <app id="var217"><lem>journey; but</lem></app> as I <app id="var218"><lem>proceeded,</lem></app> my
            spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired <app id="var219"><lem>the acquisition of knowledge. I had often,</lem></app>
            when at <app id="var220"><lem>home,</lem></app> thought <app id="var221"><lem>it</lem></app> hard <app id="var222"><lem>to</lem></app> remain <app id="var223"><lem>during my youth cooped</lem></app> up in one <app id="var224"><lem>place,</lem></app> and had
            longed to enter <app id="var225"><lem>the world,</lem></app> and take my <pb xml:id="F1831_v_048" n="32"/><app id="var226"><lem>station among</lem></app>
            other human beings. <app id="var227"><lem>Now</lem></app> my desires were <app id="var228"><lem>complied with, and</lem></app> it <app id="var229"><lem>would, indeed,</lem></app> have <app id="var230"><lem>been</lem></app>
            folly to <app id="var231"><lem>repent.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct32a"/> <anchor id="struct32b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var232"><lem>I had sufficient leisure for these and</lem></app> many other reflections during my journey to
            <app id="var233"><lem>Ingolstadt,</lem></app> which was long and <app id="var234"><lem>fatiguing.</lem></app> <app id="var235"><lem>At</lem></app> length the <app id="var236"><lem>high white steeple</lem></app> of the town
            met my eyes. I <app id="var237"><lem>alighted,</lem></app> and was conducted to my solitary <app id="var238"><lem>apartment,</lem></app> to spend the
            evening as I pleased.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct33a"/> <anchor id="struct33b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var239"><lem>The</lem></app> next morning I delivered my letters of <app id="var240"><lem>introduction,</lem></app> and paid a visit to some of
            the principal professors. <app id="var241"><lem>Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of
            Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my
            reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first</lem></app> to M. <app id="var242"><lem>Krempe, professor</lem></app> of <app id="var243"><lem>natural</lem></app>
            philosophy. He <app id="var244"><lem>was an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He</lem></app>
            asked me several questions concerning my progress in the <app id="var245"><lem>different</lem></app> branches of science
            appertaining to natural philosophy. I <app id="var246"><lem>replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt,
            mentioned the names of my alchymists as</lem></app> the <app id="var247"><lem>principal</lem></app> authors I had <app id="var248"><lem>studied.</lem></app> The
            professor <app id="var249"><lem>stared:</lem></app> “Have <app id="var250"><lem>you,” he said, “really</lem></app> spent your time in studying such
            <app id="var251"><lem>nonsense?”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct34a"/>I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every
            instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have
            burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! in what desert
            land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies,
            which you have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are
            ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple
            of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely
            anew.”<anchor id="struct34b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct35a"/> <anchor id="struct35b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var252"><lem>So saying,</lem></app> he <app id="var253"><lem>stept</lem></app> aside, and <app id="var254"><lem>wrote</lem></app> down a list of several books <app id="var255"><lem>treating of</lem></app> natural
            <app id="var256"><lem>philosophy,</lem></app> which he desired me to <app id="var257"><lem>procure;</lem></app> and dismissed <app id="var258"><lem>me,</lem></app> after mentioning that <app id="var259"><lem>in</lem></app>
            the beginning of the <app id="var260"><lem>following</lem></app> week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon
            natural philosophy <app id="var261"><lem>in its general relations,</lem></app> and that M. <app id="var262"><lem>Waldman,</lem></app> a <app id="var263"><lem>fellow-professor,</lem></app>
            would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days <app id="var264"><lem>that</lem></app> he <app id="var265"><lem>omitted.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct36a"/><pb xml:id="F1831_v_049" n="33"/>I returned home, not disappointed, for I have said
            that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
            returned, not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe
            was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher,
            therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too
            philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the
            conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been
            content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a
            confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth, and my want of a guide
            on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and
            exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists.
            Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very
            different, when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views,
            although futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the enquirer
            seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
            science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur
            for realities of little worth.<anchor id="struct36b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct37a"/> <anchor id="struct37b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var266"><lem>Such were my reflections during</lem></app> the <app id="var267"><lem>first</lem></app> two or three days <app id="var268"><lem>of my residence at
            Ingolstadt, which were chiefly</lem></app> spent <app id="var269"><lem>in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the
            principal residents in my new abode. But</lem></app> as the <app id="var270"><lem>ensuing</lem></app> week <app id="var271"><lem>commenced,</lem></app> I thought of the
            <app id="var272"><lem>information which M. Krempe</lem></app> had given me concerning the <app id="var273"><lem>lectures. And</lem></app> although I could
            not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences <app id="var274"><lem>out</lem></app> of a
            <app id="var275"><lem>pulpit,</lem></app> I recollected what he had said of <app id="var276"><lem>M. Waldman,</lem></app> whom I had never <app id="var277"><lem>seen,</lem></app> as he had
            <app id="var278"><lem>hitherto been</lem></app> out of <app id="var279"><lem>town.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct38a"/> <anchor id="struct38b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var280"><lem>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
            M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
            appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
            benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
            were <pb xml:id="F1831_v_050" n="34"/>nearly black. His person</lem></app> was <app id="var281"><lem>short,</lem></app> but remarkably
            <app id="var282"><lem>erect;</lem></app> and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture <app id="var283"><lem>by</lem></app> a
            <app id="var284"><lem>recapitulation</lem></app> of <app id="var285"><lem>the history</lem></app> of <app id="var286"><lem>chemistry,</lem></app> and <app id="var287"><lem>the</lem></app> various improvements <app id="var288"><lem>made by
            different men</lem></app> of <app id="var289"><lem>learning, pronouncing with fervour</lem></app> the names of the <app id="var290"><lem>most distinguished
            discoverers.</lem></app> He then took a cursory view of the present state of <app id="var291"><lem>the</lem></app> science, and
            explained many of its <app id="var292"><lem>elementary</lem></app> terms. <app id="var293"><lem>After having made</lem></app> a few preparatory <app id="var294"><lem>experiments,
            he concluded</lem></app> with a panegyric upon <app id="var295"><lem>modern chemistry,</lem></app> the <app id="var296"><lem>terms</lem></app> of which I shall never
            <app id="var297"><lem>forget:—</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct39a"/>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and
            performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
            be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
            hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
            crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature,
            and show how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into the heavens: they have
            discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have
            acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic
            the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”</p>
          <p>Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of fate, enounced to
            destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy;
            one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord
            after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
            one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far
            more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way,
            explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.<anchor id="struct39b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var298"><lem>I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection</lem></app> and
            <app id="var299"><lem>turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By
            degrees, after</lem></app> <app id="var300"><lem>the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts
            were as a dream. There only <pb xml:id="F1831_v_051" n="35"/>remained a resolution to
            return to my ancient studies,</lem></app> and <app id="var301"><lem>to devote myself to a science for which</lem></app> I <app id="var302"><lem>believed
            myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day, I</lem></app> paid <app id="var303"><lem>M. Waldman</lem></app> a <app id="var304"><lem>visit.</lem></app> His
            manners in private were even more mild <app id="var305"><lem>and</lem></app> attractive than in <app id="var306"><lem>public; for</lem></app> there was a
            certain dignity in his <app id="var307"><lem>mien</lem></app> during his <app id="var308"><lem>lecture,</lem></app> which <app id="var309"><lem>in his own house was</lem></app> replaced by
            the greatest <app id="var310"><lem>affability</lem></app> and <app id="var311"><lem>kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my
            former pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor. He heard with attention the
            little narration concerning my studies, and</lem></app> smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and
            <app id="var312"><lem>Paracelsus,</lem></app> but without the contempt that <app id="var313"><lem>M.</lem></app> Krempe had <app id="var314"><lem>exhibited. He said, that “these
            were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the
            foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new
            names, and arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree
            had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however
            erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of
            mankind.” I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or
            affectation; and then added,</lem></app> that his lecture had removed my <app id="var315"><lem>prejudices</lem></app> against modern
            <app id="var316"><lem>chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from
            a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made
            me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested</lem></app> his
            advice concerning the books I ought to <app id="var317"><lem>procure.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct41a"/> <anchor id="struct41b"/></p>
          <p>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application
            equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
            natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made: it is
            on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
            neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he
            attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a
            man of science, and not merely a petty ex<pb xml:id="F1831_v_052" n="36"/>perimentalist,
            I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including
            mathematics.”</p>

          <p><app id="var318"><lem>He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his various
            machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and promising me the use of his

            in the most comprehensive sense of the term,</lem></app> became <app id="var324"><lem>nearly</lem></app> my sole <app id="var325"><lem>occupation.</lem></app> I read
            with ardour <app id="var326"><lem>those works,</lem></app> so full of genius and <app id="var327"><lem>discrimination, which modern inquirers</lem></app>
            have <app id="var328"><lem>written</lem></app> on these <app id="var329"><lem>subjects.</lem></app> I attended the lectures, and <app id="var330"><lem>cultivated</lem></app> the
            <app id="var331"><lem>acquaintance,</lem></app> of the men of science of the university; and I found even in <app id="var332"><lem>M.</lem></app> Krempe a
            great deal of sound sense <app id="var333"><lem>and</lem></app> real <app id="var334"><lem>information, combined,</lem></app> it is <app id="var335"><lem>true,</lem></app> with a repulsive
            <app id="var336"><lem>physiognomy and</lem></app> manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I
            found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by <app id="var337"><lem>dogmatism;</lem></app> and his instructions
            were given with an air of frankness and good <app id="var338"><lem>nature,</lem></app> that banished every idea of
            <app id="var339"><lem>pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me</lem></app> the <app id="var340"><lem>path</lem></app> of <app id="var341"><lem>knowledge, and made</lem></app> the <app id="var342"><lem>most
            abstruse enquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application</lem></app> was <app id="var343"><lem>at first
            fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength</lem></app> as <app id="var344"><lem>I proceeded, and soon became so ardent
            and eager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst</lem></app> I was yet
            <app id="var345"><lem>engaged</lem></app> in my <app id="var346"><lem>laboratory.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct46a"/> <anchor id="struct46b"/></p>
          <p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that <app id="var347"><lem>my progress was rapid.</lem></app> My
            ardour was indeed the <app id="var348"><lem>astonishment</lem></app> of the students, and my proficiency that of the<pb xml:id="F1831_v_053" n="37"/> <app id="var349"><lem>masters.</lem></app> Professor Krempe often asked <app id="var350"><lem>me,</lem></app> with a sly
            <app id="var351"><lem>smile,</lem></app> how Cornelius Agrippa went <app id="var352"><lem>on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt
            exultation in my progress.</lem></app> Two years passed in this <app id="var353"><lem>manner,</lem></app> during which I paid no visit
            to Geneva, but <app id="var354"><lem>was engaged,</lem></app> heart and <app id="var355"><lem>soul,</lem></app> in the pursuit of some <app id="var356"><lem>discoveries,</lem></app> which I
            hoped to make. <app id="var357"><lem>None</lem></app> but those who have experienced <app id="var358"><lem>them</lem></app> can conceive of the enticements
            of <app id="var359"><lem>science.</lem></app> In other studies you go as far as others have <app id="var360"><lem>gone</lem></app> before <app id="var361"><lem>you,</lem></app> and there is
            nothing more to <app id="var362"><lem>know;</lem></app> but in a scientific pursuit <app id="var363"><lem>there</lem></app> is continual food for discovery
            and wonder. A mind of <app id="var364"><lem>moderate capacity, which</lem></app> closely pursues one <app id="var365"><lem>study,</lem></app> must
            infallibly arrive at great proficiency in <app id="var366"><lem>that study; and I,</lem></app> who <app id="var367"><lem>continually sought</lem></app> the
            attainment of one <app id="var368"><lem>object of pursuit,</lem></app> and was <app id="var369"><lem>solely wrapt</lem></app> up <app id="var370"><lem>in this,</lem></app> improved so
            <app id="var371"><lem>rapidly, that,</lem></app> at the end of <app id="var372"><lem>two years,</lem></app> I made <app id="var373"><lem>some discoveries</lem></app> in the improvement of
            some chemical <app id="var374"><lem>instruments,</lem></app> which <app id="var375"><lem>procured</lem></app> me great esteem and admiration at the
            university. When I <app id="var376"><lem>had arrived</lem></app> at this <app id="var377"><lem>point, and had become as well acquainted with the
            theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the
            professors at Ingolstadt, my</lem></app> residence <app id="var378"><lem>there being no longer conducive to my
            improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
            happened that protracted my stay.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct47a"/> <anchor id="struct47b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var379"><lem>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted</lem></app> my <app id="var380"><lem>attention was the structure of
            the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself,
            did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been
            considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
            acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did</lem></app> not <app id="var381"><lem>restrain our enquiries. I revolved
            these circumstances in my mind, and determined thenceforth to apply myself more
            particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless
            I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study
            would have been irksome, and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must
            first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the<pb xml:id="F1831_v_054" n="38"/> science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the
            natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the
            greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with</lem></app> no supernatural horrors. I do
            not ever remember <app id="var382"><lem>to have</lem></app> trembled at a <app id="var383"><lem>tale</lem></app> of <app id="var384"><lem>superstition,</lem></app> or to have feared the
            apparition of a <app id="var385"><lem>spirit.</lem></app> Darkness had no effect upon my <app id="var386"><lem>fancy;</lem></app> and a churchyard was to me
            merely <app id="var387"><lem>the</lem></app> receptacle of <app id="var388"><lem>bodies</lem></app> deprived of <app id="var389"><lem>life, which,</lem></app> from being the seat of beauty
            <app id="var390"><lem>and strength, had</lem></app> become food for the worm. <app id="var391"><lem>Now</lem></app> I was <app id="var392"><lem>led</lem></app> to examine the cause <app id="var393"><lem>and</lem></app>
            progress of this <app id="var394"><lem>decay,</lem></app> and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and <app id="var395"><lem>charnel-houses.</lem></app> My attention was fixed upon every <app id="var396"><lem>object the</lem></app> most insupportable to the delicacy
            of the human feelings. <app id="var397"><lem>I</lem></app> saw how the fine form of <app id="var398"><lem>man</lem></app> was <app id="var399"><lem>degraded</lem></app> and <app id="var400"><lem>wasted;</lem></app> I beheld
            the corruption of death succeed to the <app id="var401"><lem>blooming</lem></app> cheek of <app id="var402"><lem>life;</lem></app> I saw how the worm
            <app id="var403"><lem>inherited</lem></app> the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, <app id="var404"><lem>examining</lem></app> and <app id="var405"><lem>analysing all the</lem></app>
            minutiæ of <app id="var406"><lem>causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to
            life, until</lem></app> from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon <app id="var407"><lem>me—a</lem></app> light so
            brilliant <app id="var408"><lem>and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of
            the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised, that among so many men of genius who
            had directed their enquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved
            to discover so astonishing a secret.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct48a"/> <anchor id="struct48b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var409"><lem>Remember,</lem></app> I am <app id="var410"><lem>not</lem></app> recording the <app id="var411"><lem>vision of</lem></app> a <app id="var412"><lem>madman.</lem></app> <app id="var413"><lem>The</lem></app> sun does not more certainly

            produced <app id="var417"><lem>it, yet</lem></app> the stages of <app id="var418"><lem>the discovery</lem></app> were distinct and probable. After days and
            nights of incredible <app id="var419"><lem>labour</lem></app> and <app id="var420"><lem>fatigue,</lem></app> I succeeded in discovering the cause of
            generation <app id="var421"><lem>and life; nay,</lem></app> more, I <app id="var422"><lem>became</lem></app> myself capable of bestowing animation upon

          <p><anchor id="struct49a"/> <anchor id="struct49b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var424"><lem>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to
            delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at

            discovery was so<pb xml:id="F1831_v_055" n="39"/> great and overwhelming, that all the
            steps</lem></app> by which I had been progressively led to it were <app id="var425"><lem>obliterated,</lem></app> and I <app id="var426"><lem>beheld</lem></app> only
            the result. What had been the study and desire of the <app id="var427"><lem>wisest</lem></app> men since the creation of

            at <app id="var431"><lem>once:</lem></app> the <app id="var432"><lem>information</lem></app> I had obtained was <app id="var433"><lem>of</lem></app> a nature rather <app id="var434"><lem>to</lem></app> direct my <app id="var435"><lem>endeavours
            so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search, than to exhibit that

            animal as complex and wonderful as man. <app id="var467"><lem>The materials at present within</lem></app> my command

            <app id="var487"><lem>species</lem></app> would bless me as its <app id="var488"><lem>creator</lem></app> and source; many happy and excellent <app id="var489"><lem>natures</lem></app> would
            owe their <app id="var490"><lem>being</lem></app> to me. <app id="var491"><lem>No</lem></app> father could claim the gratitude of his child <app id="var492"><lem>so completely as
            I should deserve theirs. Pursuing</lem></app> these <app id="var493"><lem>reflections,</lem></app> I <app id="var494"><lem>thought,</lem></app> that if I could bestow
            <app id="var495"><lem>animation upon</lem></app> lifeless <app id="var496"><lem>matter,</lem></app> I might in process of time (although I now <app id="var497"><lem>found it
            impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct53a"/> <anchor id="struct53b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var498"><lem>These</lem></app> thoughts supported my <app id="var499"><lem>spirits,</lem></app> while I pursued my <app id="var500"><lem>undertaking</lem></app> with unremitting
            <app id="var501"><lem>ardour.</lem></app> My cheek <app id="var502"><lem>had grown</lem></app> pale with study, and <app id="var503"><lem>my</lem></app> person <app id="var504"><lem>had become emaciated with</lem></app>
            confinement. <app id="var505"><lem>Sometimes,</lem></app> on the very brink of <app id="var506"><lem>certainty,</lem></app> I <app id="var507"><lem>failed;</lem></app> yet <app id="var508"><lem>still I</lem></app> clung to
            the hope which the next day or the <app id="var509"><lem>next</lem></app> hour might <app id="var510"><lem>realise.</lem></app> One secret which I alone
            <app id="var511"><lem>possessed</lem></app> was the hope to which I <app id="var512"><lem>had dedicated myself;</lem></app> and the moon gazed on my
            midnight <app id="var513"><lem>labours, while,</lem></app> with unrelaxed <app id="var514"><lem>and</lem></app> breathless <app id="var515"><lem>eagerness,</lem></app> I pursued nature to
            her <app id="var516"><lem>hiding-places. Who</lem></app> shall <app id="var517"><lem>conceive</lem></app> the horrors of my secret <app id="var518"><lem>toil,</lem></app> as I dabbled among
            the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the living <app id="var519"><lem>animal</lem></app> to animate <app id="var520"><lem>the</lem></app> lifeless
            clay? <app id="var521"><lem>My</lem></app> limbs <app id="var522"><lem>now tremble,</lem></app> and my eyes swim with the <app id="var523"><lem>remembrance;</lem></app> but then a
            <app id="var524"><lem>resistless,</lem></app> and <app id="var525"><lem>almost<pb xml:id="F1831_v_057" n="41"/> frantic, impulse,</lem></app> urged me
            <app id="var526"><lem>forward;</lem></app> I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for <app id="var527"><lem>this one</lem></app> pursuit. It was
            indeed <app id="var528"><lem>but a</lem></app> passing <app id="var529"><lem>trance,</lem></app> that only made me feel with <app id="var530"><lem>renewed acuteness so soon as,
            the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected
            bones from charnel-houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets
            of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and
            separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop
            of filthy creation: my eye-balls were starting from their sockets in attending to the
            details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of
            my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
            whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work
            near to a conclusion.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct54a"/>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It
            was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest, or
            the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of
            nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
            to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so
            long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the words of my
            father: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you will think of us with
            affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any
            interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally
            neglected.”<anchor id="struct54b"/></p>

          <p>I <app id="var531"><lem>knew</lem></app> well therefore what <app id="var532"><lem>would</lem></app> be <app id="var533"><lem>my father’s feelings;</lem></app> but I could not tear my
            thoughts from my <app id="var534"><lem>employment,</lem></app> loathsome in <app id="var535"><lem>itself,</lem></app> but which had taken an <app id="var536"><lem>irresistible</lem></app>
            hold of my <app id="var537"><lem>imagination.</lem></app> I <app id="var538"><lem>wished,</lem></app> as it <app id="var539"><lem>were,</lem></app> to <app id="var540"><lem>procrastinate</lem></app> all that related to my
            feelings of <app id="var541"><lem>affection until</lem></app> the great <app id="var542"><lem>object,</lem></app> which swallowed up every habit <app id="var543"><lem>of my

          <p><anchor id="struct57a"/> <anchor id="struct57b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var545"><lem>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice, or
            faultiness</lem></app> on <app id="var546"><lem>my part; but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving
              that<pb xml:id="F1831_v_058" n="42"/> I should not be altogether free from blame. A
            human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never</lem></app>
            to <app id="var547"><lem>allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that
            the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply
            yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those
            simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly
            unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the</lem></app> human mind. If this <app id="var548"><lem>rule were always</lem></app>
            observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with <app id="var549"><lem>the</lem></app> tranquillity <app id="var550"><lem>of</lem></app>

          <p>My father made no reproach in his letters, and only took notice of my silence by
            enquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer
            passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding
            leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed
            in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a
            close; and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my
            enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery
            to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than an artist occupied by his
            favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous
            to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my
            fellow-creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the
            wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my
            labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away
            incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be
              complete.</p>

          <p><app id="var563"><lem> I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi></lem></app> was on a dreary night of <app id="var564"><lem>November,</lem></app> that I beheld the
            <app id="var565"><lem>accomplishment of</lem></app> my <app id="var566"><lem>toils. With</lem></app> an anxiety that almost <app id="var567"><lem>amounted</lem></app> to <app id="var568"><lem>agony,</lem></app> I collected
            <app id="var569"><lem>the instruments</lem></app> of life around <app id="var570"><lem>me,</lem></app> that I might <app id="var571"><lem>infuse</lem></app> a spark of being into the
            lifeless <app id="var572"><lem>thing</lem></app> that lay at my feet. It was already one in the <app id="var573"><lem>morning;</lem></app> the rain pattered
            dismally against the <app id="var574"><lem>panes, and</lem></app> my candle was nearly burnt out, <app id="var575"><lem>when,</lem></app> by the glimmer of
            the <app id="var576"><lem>half-extinguished light,</lem></app> I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature <app id="var577"><lem>open; it</lem></app> breathed
            hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its <app id="var578"><lem>limbs.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct62a"/>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
            with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in
            proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His
            yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a
            lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only
            formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same
            colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and
            straight black lips.<anchor id="struct62b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct63a"/> <anchor id="struct63b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var579"><lem>The</lem></app> different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of <app id="var580"><lem>human</lem></app> nature.
            I had worked hard for nearly two <app id="var581"><lem>years,</lem></app> for the sole purpose of infusing <app id="var582"><lem>life</lem></app> into an
            inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and <app id="var583"><lem>health.</lem></app> I had desired it with
            an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had <app id="var584"><lem>finished, the beauty of the
            dream vanished,</lem></app> and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable <app id="var585"><lem>to</lem></app> endure the
            aspect of the <app id="var586"><lem>being</lem></app> I had created, I rushed out of the <app id="var587"><lem>room,</lem></app> and <app id="var588"><lem>continued</lem></app> a long time
            traversing my <app id="var589"><lem>bedchamber,</lem></app> unable to compose my mind to sleep. At <app id="var590"><lem>length lassitude</lem></app>
            succeeded to the tumult I had before <app id="var591"><lem>endured;</lem></app> and I threw myself on <app id="var592"><lem>the</lem></app> bed in my
            <app id="var593"><lem>clothes,</lem></app> endeavouring to seek a <app id="var594"><lem>few</lem></app> moments of <app id="var595"><lem>forgetfulness.</lem></app> But it was in <app id="var596"><lem>vain:</lem></app> I
            <app id="var597"><lem>slept, indeed,</lem></app> but I was disturbed by the wildest <app id="var598"><lem>dreams.</lem></app> I <app id="var599"><lem>thought I saw Elizabeth,</lem></app> in
            the bloom of <app id="var600"><lem>health,</lem></app> walking in the streets of<pb xml:id="F1831_v_060" n="44"/>
            <app id="var601"><lem>Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised,</lem></app> I embraced <app id="var602"><lem>her;</lem></app> but as I imprinted the first kiss
            on her <app id="var603"><lem>lips,</lem></app> they became <app id="var604"><lem>livid</lem></app> with the hue of death; her features <app id="var605"><lem>appeared to change,
            and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped
            her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from
            my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb
            became convulsed: when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way
            through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had
            created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called,
            were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a
            grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was
            stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took
            refuge in the court-yard belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained
            during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening
            attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of
            the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct64a"/>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with
            animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished;
            he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it
            became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>
          <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that I
            felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through
            languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of
            disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were
            now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!<anchor id="struct64b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct65a"/> <anchor id="struct65b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var606"><lem>Morning,</lem></app> dismal and <app id="var607"><lem>wet, at length</lem></app> dawned, and <app id="var608"><lem>discovered</lem></app> to my sleepless and aching
            eyes the church of <app id="var609"><lem>Ingolstadt,</lem></app> its white steeple <app id="var610"><lem>and clock,</lem></app> which <app id="var611"><lem>indicated</lem></app> the<pb xml:id="F1831_v_061" n="45"/> <app id="var612"><lem>sixth</lem></app> hour. The porter opened the gates of the <app id="var613"><lem>court,</lem></app>
            which had that night been my <app id="var614"><lem>asylum,</lem></app> and I issued into the streets, pacing them with
            quick <app id="var615"><lem>steps,</lem></app> as if I <app id="var616"><lem>sought</lem></app> to <app id="var617"><lem>avoid the</lem></app> wretch whom I feared every <app id="var618"><lem>turning of</lem></app> the
            street would present <app id="var619"><lem>to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I
            inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
            from a black and comfortless sky.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct66a"/> <anchor id="struct66b"/></p>
          <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to
            ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets, without any clear
            conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of
            fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:—</p>

          <p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences
            and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some
            minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of
            the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped
            just where I was standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval,
            who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad
            I am to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my
            alighting!”<anchor id="struct67b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var620"><lem>Nothing</lem></app> could equal my delight on <app id="var621"><lem>seeing Clerval;</lem></app> his presence brought back to my
            thoughts my <app id="var622"><lem>father, Elizabeth,</lem></app> and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.
            I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and <app id="var623"><lem>misfortune;</lem></app> I felt <app id="var624"><lem>suddenly,</lem></app>
            and for the first time <app id="var625"><lem>during many</lem></app> months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my <app id="var626"><lem>friend,
            therefore,</lem></app> in the most cordial <app id="var627"><lem>manner, and</lem></app> we walked towards my <app id="var628"><lem>college.</lem></app> Clerval
            <app id="var629"><lem>continued</lem></app> talking for some time about <app id="var630"><lem>our</lem></app> mutual <app id="var631"><lem>friends,</lem></app> and his <app id="var632"><lem>own<pb xml:id="F1831_v_062" n="46"/> good</lem></app> fortune in being <app id="var633"><lem>permitted</lem></app> to come to Ingolstadt.
            “You may <app id="var634"><lem>easily believe,”</lem></app> said he, <app id="var635"><lem>“how great</lem></app> was <app id="var636"><lem>the difficulty to persuade my father
            that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and,
            indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my
            unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in the Vicar of

            aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy <app id="var689"><lem>on</lem></app> his <app id="var690"><lem>arrival;</lem></app> but when <app id="var691"><lem>he</lem></app>

          <p><anchor id="struct77a"/>But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting

            him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry: he at first believed them to be the wanderings
            of my disturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to
            the same subject, persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon

          <p> C<hi rend="smallcaps">LERVAL</hi> then put the following letter into my hands. It was
            from my own Elizabeth:—</p>
          <p>“My dearest Cousin,</p>
          <p>“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not
            sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet
            one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time
            I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained
            my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the
            inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey; yet how often have I regretted
            not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on
            your sick bed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your
            wishes, nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that
            is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you
            will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.</p>
          <p>“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home, and friends who love
            you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you,—but to be
            assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.
            How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen, and
            full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss, and to enter into
            foreign service;<pb xml:id="F1831_v_066" n="50"/> but we cannot part with him, at least
            until his elder brother return to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a
            military career in a distant country; but Ernest never had your powers of application.
            He looks upon study as an odious fetter;—his time is spent in the open air, climbing the
            hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler, unless we yield the
            point, and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.<anchor id="struct81b"/></p>

            words. <app id="var757"><lem>Madame Moritz,</lem></app> her <app id="var758"><lem>mother,</lem></app> was a widow with four <app id="var759"><lem>children,</lem></app> of whom <app id="var760"><lem>Justine</lem></app> was
            the third. This girl had always been the <app id="var761"><lem>favourite</lem></app> of her <app id="var762"><lem>father; but, through a strange
            perversity,</lem></app> her <app id="var763"><lem>mother</lem></app> could <app id="var764"><lem>not</lem></app> endure <app id="var765"><lem>her, and,</lem></app> after the death of M. <app id="var766"><lem>Moritz,</lem></app> treated
            her very ill. My aunt observed <app id="var767"><lem>this; and,</lem></app> when Justine was <app id="var768"><lem>twelve</lem></app> years <app id="var769"><lem>of age,</lem></app>
            prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our <app id="var770"><lem>house. The republican institutions
            of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the
            great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several
            classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised,
            their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
            thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned
            the duties of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include
            the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var859"><lem>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several
            professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill
            befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of
            my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy
            even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health,
            the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.
            Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my
            apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
            previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I
            visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and
            warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I
            disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
            modesty, and</lem></app> changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with <app id="var860"><lem>a
            desire,</lem></app> as I evidently <app id="var861"><lem>saw,</lem></app> of drawing <app id="var862"><lem>me</lem></app> out. <app id="var863"><lem>What</lem></app> could I do? He meant to <app id="var864"><lem>please,</lem></app> and
            <app id="var865"><lem>he tormented me.</lem></app> I felt as if he had <app id="var866"><lem>placed carefully,</lem></app> one by <app id="var867"><lem>one,</lem></app> in my view those
            instruments which were <app id="var868"><lem>to be afterwards</lem></app> used in putting me to a slow and cruel <app id="var869"><lem>death.</lem></app> I
            writhed under his words, yet dared not <app id="var870"><lem>exhibit</lem></app> the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and
            feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of <app id="var871"><lem>others,</lem></app> declined the <app id="var872"><lem>subject,
            alleging,</lem></app> in <app id="var873"><lem>excuse,</lem></app> his <app id="var874"><lem>total ignorance; and</lem></app> the conversation took a more general turn.
            I thanked <app id="var875"><lem>my friend</lem></app> from my heart, but I did not speak. I <app id="var876"><lem>saw plainly</lem></app> that he was
            surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from <app id="var877"><lem>me;</lem></app> and although I loved him
            with a mixture of <app id="var878"><lem>affection</lem></app> and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never
            <app id="var879"><lem>persuade</lem></app> myself to confide to him that event which was so often present to my
            <app id="var880"><lem>recollection,</lem></app> but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more

            pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came</lem></app> to <app id="var914"><lem>the university

            should open</lem></app> a field for <app id="var915"><lem>the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to

            attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness</lem></app> had ever been

            had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also
            suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the

            motionless: the print of the murderer’s finger was on his neck.</p>

          <p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
            the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my
            friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.</p>
          <p>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
            “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?”<anchor id="struct114b"/></p>
          <p>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the

            express his heartfelt</lem></app> sympathy. “Poor <app id="var1097"><lem>William!”</lem></app> said <app id="var1098"><lem>he,</lem></app> “dear <app id="var1099"><lem>lovely child,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1831_v_075" n="59"/>he now sleeps with his angel <app id="var1100"><lem>mother!

          <p><anchor id="struct118a"/>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on
            my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses
            arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.<anchor id="struct118b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1106"><lem>My</lem></app> journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry <app id="var1107"><lem>on,</lem></app> for I longed to console

            into my mind. I passed <app id="var1113"><lem>through</lem></app> scenes familiar to my <app id="var1114"><lem>youth,</lem></app> but which I had not seen for
            nearly <app id="var1115"><lem>six years. How</lem></app> altered every thing might be during <app id="var1116"><lem>that time! One</lem></app> sudden and

            not be <app id="var1122"><lem>the less decisive.</lem></app> Fear overcame <app id="var1123"><lem>me;</lem></app> I dared <app id="var1124"><lem>not advance,</lem></app> dreading a <app id="var1125"><lem>thousand</lem></app>
            nameless evils that made me <app id="var1126"><lem>tremble,</lem></app> although I <app id="var1127"><lem>was unable to define them.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct119a"/>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the
            lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, “the palaces

            were already <app id="var1164"><lem>shut;</lem></app> and I <app id="var1165"><lem>was obliged</lem></app> to <app id="var1166"><lem>pass the</lem></app> night at <app id="var1167"><lem>Secheron, a village at the

            <app id="var1169"><lem>rest,</lem></app> I resolved to <app id="var1170"><lem>visit</lem></app> the spot where <app id="var1171"><lem>my</lem></app> poor William had been <app id="var1172"><lem>murdered. As</lem></app> I <app id="var1173"><lem>could

            Blanc</lem></app> in the most beautiful <app id="var1178"><lem>figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly; and, on

          <p><anchor id="struct124a"/>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every
            minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from
            Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes,
            illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
            every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered <pb xml:id="F1831_v_077" n="61"/>itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
            Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm
            hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
            promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
            faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain
            to the east of the lake.<anchor id="struct124b"/></p>

            <app id="var1188"><lem>step. This</lem></app> noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my <app id="var1189"><lem>hands, and exclaimed
            aloud,</lem></app> “William, dear <app id="var1190"><lem>angel!</lem></app> this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these
            <app id="var1191"><lem>words, I</lem></app> perceived in the gloom <app id="var1192"><lem>a</lem></app> figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near
            <app id="var1193"><lem>me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
            illuminated the object, and discovered</lem></app> its <app id="var1194"><lem>shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature,
            and</lem></app> the deformity of its <app id="var1195"><lem>aspect, more</lem></app> hideous <app id="var1196"><lem>than belongs to humanity, instantly
            informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did
            he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No
            sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my
            teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against</lem></app> a <app id="var1197"><lem>tree for support. The figure passed
            me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that
            fair child. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was the murderer! I</lem></app> could <app id="var1198"><lem>not doubt it. The mere
            presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the
            devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging
            among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds
            Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var1223"><lem>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night,</lem></app> which I
            <app id="var1224"><lem>spent, cold and wet,</lem></app> in the open air. <app id="var1225"><lem>But</lem></app> I did not feel <app id="var1226"><lem>the inconvenience</lem></app> of the
            <app id="var1227"><lem>weather;</lem></app> my imagination was busy in <app id="var1228"><lem>scenes</lem></app> of <app id="var1229"><lem>evil</lem></app> and <app id="var1230"><lem>despair.</lem></app> I considered the <app id="var1231"><lem>being</lem></app>
            whom I had cast <app id="var1232"><lem>among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect</lem></app> purposes of
            <app id="var1233"><lem>horror,</lem></app> such as <app id="var1234"><lem>the</lem></app> deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my <app id="var1235"><lem>own vampire,</lem></app>
            my own spirit let loose from the <app id="var1236"><lem>grave,</lem></app> and forced to destroy all <app id="var1237"><lem>that</lem></app> <app id="var1238"><lem>was dear to
            me.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct129a"/>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I
            hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the
            murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the
            story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had
            met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also
            the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my
            creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly
            improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I
            should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of
            the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my
            relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a
            creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections
            determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.</p>
          <p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants
            not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of
            rising.<anchor id="struct129b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1239"><lem>Six</lem></app> years had <app id="var1240"><lem>elapsed, passed</lem></app> as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in
            the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.
            Beloved and <app id="var1241"><lem>venerable</lem></app> parent! <app id="var1242"><lem>He</lem></app> still remained to me. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_079" n="63"/>I gazed on <app id="var1243"><lem>the</lem></app> picture of my <app id="var1244"><lem>mother,</lem></app> which stood over the <app id="var1245"><lem>mantel-piece.</lem></app> It was an
            historical <app id="var1246"><lem>subject,</lem></app> painted <app id="var1247"><lem>at my father’s desire,</lem></app> and represented Caroline <app id="var1248"><lem>Beaufort</lem></app> in
            an agony of <app id="var1249"><lem>despair,</lem></app> kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, <app id="var1250"><lem>and</lem></app>
            her cheek <app id="var1251"><lem>pale;</lem></app> but there was an air of dignity and <app id="var1252"><lem>beauty,</lem></app> that hardly <app id="var1253"><lem>permitted</lem></app> the
            <app id="var1254"><lem>sentiment</lem></app> of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of <app id="var1255"><lem>William;</lem></app> and my tears flowed
            when I looked upon <app id="var1256"><lem>it. While</lem></app> I was thus <app id="var1257"><lem>engaged,</lem></app> Ernest <app id="var1258"><lem>entered:</lem></app> he had heard me <app id="var1259"><lem>arrive,</lem></app>
            and hastened to welcome me. He expressed <app id="var1260"><lem>a sorrowful</lem></app> delight <app id="var1261"><lem>to see me:</lem></app> <app id="var1262"><lem>“Welcome,</lem></app> my
            dearest Victor,” said <app id="var1263"><lem>he. “Ah!</lem></app> I wish you had come three <app id="var1264"><lem>months ago, and then you would
            have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which
            nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
            sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease
            her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and our
            pride!”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct131a"/>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my
            frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality
            came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I
            enquired more minutely concerning my father, and her I named my cousin.</p>
          <p>“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused herself of having
            caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer
            has been discovered—”<anchor id="struct131b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct133a"/>“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of wonder, “but to us the
            discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even
            now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would
            credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all <pb xml:id="F1831_v_080" n="64"/>the family, could suddenly become capable of so frightful, so appalling a
            crime?”</p>
          <p>“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one

          <p><anchor id="struct135a"/> <anchor id="struct135b"/></p>
          <p>“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced
            conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the
            evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried
            to-day, and you will then hear all.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct136a"/> <anchor id="struct136b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1274"><lem>He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered,
            Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days. During this
            interval,</lem></app> one of the <app id="var1275"><lem>servants, happening</lem></app> to examine the apparel she had worn on the
            night of the <app id="var1276"><lem>murder, had</lem></app> discovered in her pocket the picture of my <app id="var1277"><lem>mother,</lem></app> which had
            been judged to be the <app id="var1278"><lem>temptation</lem></app> of the murderer. The servant instantly <app id="var1279"><lem>showed</lem></app> it to one
            of the others, <app id="var1280"><lem>who,</lem></app> without saying a word to any of the <app id="var1281"><lem>family,</lem></app> went to a <app id="var1282"><lem>magistrate;
            and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On</lem></app> being charged with the <app id="var1283"><lem>fact, the
            poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
            manner.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct137a"/>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You
            are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”</p>
          <p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his
            countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged
            our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster,
            had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the
            murderer of poor William.”</p>
          <p>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather have been for
            ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so
            highly.”</p>
          <p>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”</p>
          <p>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_081" n="65"/>She is to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be
            acquitted.”<anchor id="struct137b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct138a"/> <anchor id="struct138b"/></p>
          <p>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed
            every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any
            circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale
            was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness
            by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe,
            unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption
            and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?</p>

          <p><app id="var1284"><lem>We</lem></app> were soon joined <app id="var1285"><lem>by</lem></app> Elizabeth. Time had <app id="var1286"><lem>altered her</lem></app> since I <app id="var1287"><lem>last</lem></app> beheld <app id="var1288"><lem>her; it had
            endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There</lem></app> was <app id="var1289"><lem>the

            am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my

          <p><anchor id="struct140a"/>“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but

          <p><app id="var1307"><lem>W<hi rend="smallcaps">E</hi> passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock, when the
            trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as
            witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of
            justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether the result of my
            curiosity and lawless devices would cause the</lem></app> death of two of my <app id="var1308"><lem>fellow-beings: one</lem></app> a
            smiling <app id="var1309"><lem>babe,</lem></app> full of innocence and <app id="var1310"><lem>joy;</lem></app> the other far more dreadfully <app id="var1311"><lem>murdered,</lem></app> with

            was a girl of <app id="var1315"><lem>merit,</lem></app> and possessed qualities which promised to render her <app id="var1316"><lem>life happy:</lem></app>
            now all was to be <app id="var1317"><lem>obliterated</lem></app> in <app id="var1318"><lem>an</lem></app> ignominious <app id="var1319"><lem>grave;</lem></app> <app id="var1320"><lem>and</lem></app> I the cause! A thousand times
            rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to <app id="var1321"><lem>Justine;</lem></app> but I was
            absent when it was <app id="var1322"><lem>committed,</lem></app> and such a declaration would <app id="var1323"><lem>have been</lem></app> considered as the
            ravings of a <app id="var1324"><lem>madman,</lem></app> and <app id="var1325"><lem>would</lem></app> not have <app id="var1326"><lem>exculpated</lem></app> her who suffered through <app id="var1327"><lem>me.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct144a"/>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
            always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
            Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and
            execrated by thousands; for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
            excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the
            enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was
            evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her
            guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court,
            she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear <pb xml:id="F1831_v_083" n="67"/>seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly
            recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter
              guiltlessness.<anchor id="struct144b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1328"><lem>The</lem></app> trial <app id="var1329"><lem>began; and,</lem></app> after the advocate against her had stated the <app id="var1330"><lem>charge,</lem></app> several

            staggered any one who had not such <app id="var1333"><lem>proof</lem></app> of her innocence as I had. She had been out the
            whole of the night on which the <app id="var1334"><lem>murder</lem></app> had been <app id="var1335"><lem>committed,</lem></app> and towards morning had been
            perceived by a <app id="var1336"><lem>market-woman</lem></app> not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child
            had been afterwards found. <app id="var1337"><lem>The</lem></app> woman asked <app id="var1338"><lem>her</lem></app> what she did <app id="var1339"><lem>there;</lem></app> but she looked very
            <app id="var1340"><lem>strangely,</lem></app> and only returned a confused <app id="var1341"><lem>and unintelligible answer. She</lem></app> returned to the
            house about eight <app id="var1342"><lem>o’clock; and,</lem></app> when <app id="var1343"><lem>one</lem></app> enquired where she had passed the <app id="var1344"><lem>night,</lem></app> she
            replied that she had been looking <app id="var1345"><lem>for</lem></app> the <app id="var1346"><lem>child,</lem></app> and <app id="var1347"><lem>demanded</lem></app> earnestly if any thing had
            been heard <app id="var1348"><lem>concerning</lem></app> him. When <app id="var1349"><lem>shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and
            kept her bed for several days. The picture</lem></app> was <app id="var1350"><lem>then produced, which the servant had
            found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the
            same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a
            murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct146a"/>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had
            altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled
            with her tears; but, when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke,
            in an audible, although variable voice.<anchor id="struct146b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct147a"/> <anchor id="struct147b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1351"><lem>“God</lem></app> knows,” she said, <app id="var1352"><lem>“how</lem></app> entirely I am <app id="var1353"><lem>innocent. But</lem></app> I do not pretend <app id="var1354"><lem>that</lem></app> my

          <p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of
            the night on which the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_084" n="68"/>murder had been committed at the
            house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her
            return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing of
            the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in
            looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
            several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up

            towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her,
            and she awoke. It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
            to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her
            knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not
            surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was yet
            uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account.</p>

          <p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s

          <p>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not
            one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I

            Elizabeth <app id="var1562"><lem>could tear</lem></app> herself <app id="var1563"><lem>away.</lem></app> “I <app id="var1564"><lem>wish,”</lem></app> cried <app id="var1565"><lem>she,</lem></app> “that I were to die with <app id="var1566"><lem>you;</lem></app> I
            cannot live in <app id="var1567"><lem>this</lem></app> world of misery.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct165a"/>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter
            tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed emotion,
            “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may Heaven, in its
            bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
            suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”</p>
          <p>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the
            judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My
            passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold
            answers, and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died
            away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence
            passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!</p>
          <p>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief
            of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father’s woe, and the desolation of that
            late so smiling home—all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy
            ones; but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise <pb xml:id="F1831_v_090" n="74"/>the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be
            heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would
            spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes—who has no thought nor sense of joy,
            except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances—who would fill the air with
            blessings, and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep—to shed countless tears;
            happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
            pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!</p>
          <p>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those
            I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless
            victims to my unhallowed arts. <comment text="ebb: centered underscore a few lines               below"/></p>

            Justine <app id="var1576"><lem>died; she rested; and</lem></app> I was <app id="var1577"><lem>alive. The</lem></app> blood flowed freely in my <app id="var1578"><lem>veins,</lem></app> but a
            weight of despair <app id="var1579"><lem>and</lem></app> remorse pressed on my <app id="var1580"><lem>heart,</lem></app> which nothing could <app id="var1581"><lem>remove.</lem></app> Sleep
            fled from my <app id="var1582"><lem>eyes;</lem></app> I wandered like an evil <app id="var1583"><lem>spirit,</lem></app> for I <app id="var1584"><lem>had</lem></app> committed deeds of mischief
            beyond description <app id="var1585"><lem>horrible,</lem></app> and <app id="var1586"><lem>more,</lem></app> much more (I persuaded <app id="var1587"><lem>myself),</lem></app> was yet <app id="var1588"><lem>behind.</lem></app>
            Yet my heart overflowed with <app id="var1589"><lem>kindness,</lem></app> and <app id="var1590"><lem>the love of virtue.</lem></app> I had begun life with

            and make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now all was blasted: instead of that
            serenity of conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past with
            self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by
            remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures,
            such as no language can describe.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct167a"/><pb xml:id="F1831_v_091" n="75"/>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had
            perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the
            face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only
            consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.<anchor id="struct167b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1614"><lem>About</lem></app> this time <app id="var1615"><lem>we</lem></app> retired to our house at Belrive. This <app id="var1616"><lem>change</lem></app> was <app id="var1617"><lem>particularly
            agreeable</lem></app> to <app id="var1618"><lem>me.</lem></app> The shutting of the gates <app id="var1619"><lem>regularly</lem></app> at ten <app id="var1620"><lem>o’clock,</lem></app> and the
            impossibility of <app id="var1621"><lem>remaining</lem></app> on the lake after that <app id="var1622"><lem>hour, had</lem></app> rendered our residence
            within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now <app id="var1623"><lem>free. Often,</lem></app> after the rest of
            the family had retired for the <app id="var1624"><lem>night,</lem></app> I took the <app id="var1625"><lem>boat,</lem></app> and passed <app id="var1626"><lem>many hours</lem></app> upon the
            <app id="var1627"><lem>water. Sometimes,</lem></app> with my sails <app id="var1628"><lem>set,</lem></app> I was carried by the <app id="var1629"><lem>wind;</lem></app> and <app id="var1630"><lem>sometimes,</lem></app> after
            <app id="var1631"><lem>rowing</lem></app> into the middle of the <app id="var1632"><lem>lake,</lem></app> I left the boat to <app id="var1633"><lem>pursue</lem></app> its own <app id="var1634"><lem>course,</lem></app> and <app id="var1635"><lem>gave
            way</lem></app> to my own miserable reflections. I was often <app id="var1636"><lem>tempted,</lem></app> when all was <app id="var1637"><lem>at</lem></app> peace around
            <app id="var1638"><lem>me,</lem></app> and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a <app id="var1639"><lem>scene so beautiful and
            heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was
            heard only when I ap<pb xml:id="F1831_v_092" n="76"/>proached the shore—often, I say, I
            was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my
            calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering
            Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought
            also of my father, and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave them
            exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct171a"/>At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that
            I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse
            extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils; and I lived in
            daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I
            had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit some signal
            crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There
            was always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved remained behind. My abhorrence
            of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes
            became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so
            thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge
            burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of
            the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him
            again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head, and avenge the
            deaths of William and Justine.</p>
          <p>Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply shaken by the horror
            of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in
            her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal
            woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so
            blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth
            wandered with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with ecstasy of our future
            prospects. The first of those sorrows which are <pb xml:id="F1831_v_093" n="77"/>sent to
            wean us from the earth, had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
            smiles.<anchor id="struct171b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1640"><lem>“When</lem></app> I reflect, my dear <app id="var1641"><lem>cousin,”</lem></app> said <app id="var1642"><lem>she, “on</lem></app> the miserable death of Justine Moritz,
            I no longer see <app id="var1643"><lem>the</lem></app> world and its works <app id="var1644"><lem>as</lem></app> they before appeared to <app id="var1645"><lem>me. Before,</lem></app> <app id="var1646"><lem>I</lem></app> looked
            upon the accounts of vice and <app id="var1647"><lem>injustice,</lem></app> that I read in books or heard from <app id="var1648"><lem>others,</lem></app> as
            tales of ancient <app id="var1649"><lem>days,</lem></app> or imaginary <app id="var1650"><lem>evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar
            to reason than to the imagination;</lem></app> but now misery has come <app id="var1651"><lem>home,</lem></app> and men appear to me as
            monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly <app id="var1652"><lem>unjust. Every body</lem></app>
            believed that poor girl to be <app id="var1653"><lem>guilty;</lem></app> and if she <app id="var1654"><lem>could</lem></app> have committed the crime for
            which she suffered, assuredly she would <app id="var1655"><lem>have</lem></app> been the most depraved of <app id="var1656"><lem>human</lem></app> creatures.
            For the sake of a few <app id="var1657"><lem>jewels,</lem></app> to have murdered the son of her benefactor <app id="var1658"><lem>and</lem></app> friend, a
            child whom she had nursed from its <app id="var1659"><lem>birth,</lem></app> and appeared to love as if it had been <app id="var1660"><lem>her
            own!</lem></app> I could not consent to the death of any human <app id="var1661"><lem>being;</lem></app> but certainly I should have
            thought such a <app id="var1662"><lem>creature</lem></app> unfit to remain in the society of men. <app id="var1663"><lem>But</lem></app> she was <app id="var1664"><lem>innocent. I
            know, I</lem></app> feel she was <app id="var1665"><lem>innocent; you</lem></app> are of the same <app id="var1666"><lem>opinion,</lem></app> and that confirms me. <app id="var1667"><lem>Alas!
            Victor,</lem></app> when <app id="var1668"><lem>falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain
            happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands
            are crowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were
            assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps
            respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I
            would not change places with such a wretch.”</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var1669"><lem>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I,</lem></app> not <app id="var1670"><lem>in deed,</lem></app> but in <app id="var1671"><lem>effect,</lem></app>
            was the true <app id="var1672"><lem>murderer.</lem></app> Elizabeth read my anguish in my <app id="var1673"><lem>countenance,</lem></app> and kindly taking my
            <app id="var1674"><lem>hand, said, “My</lem></app> dearest <app id="var1675"><lem>friend,</lem></app> you must calm <app id="var1676"><lem>yourself. These</lem></app> events have <app id="var1677"><lem>affected me,
            God</lem></app> knows how <app id="var1678"><lem>deeply;</lem></app> but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of

            Victor, <app id="var1683"><lem>banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_094" n="78"/>who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power
            of rendering you happy? Ah! while we love—while we are true to each other, here</lem></app> in <app id="var1684"><lem>this
            land of peace and beauty, your</lem></app> native <app id="var1685"><lem>country, we may reap every tranquil blessing,—what
            can disturb our peace?”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct174a"/>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of
            fortune, suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I
            drew near to her, as if in terror; lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near
            to rob me of her. </p>
          <p>Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could
            redeem my soul from woe: the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by
            a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its
            fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced
            it, and to die—was but a type of me.</p>
          <p>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but sometimes the
            whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of
            place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was during an access of this kind
            that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys,
            sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my
            ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of
            Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since
            then: <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was a wreck—but nought had changed in those savage and
            enduring scenes.<anchor id="struct174b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct175a"/> <anchor id="struct175b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1686"><lem>I performed the</lem></app> first <app id="var1687"><lem>part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired</lem></app> a <app id="var1688"><lem>mule, as</lem></app>
            the <app id="var1689"><lem>more sure-footed, and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The
            weather was fine: it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months
            after</lem></app> the <app id="var1690"><lem>death of Justine; that miserable epoch from</lem></app> which <app id="var1691"><lem>I dated all my woe. The
            weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of
            Arve. The</lem></app> immense mountains <app id="var1692"><lem>and precipices that overhung me</lem></app> on <app id="var1693"><lem>every side—the</lem></app> sound of
            <app id="var1694"><lem>the</lem></app> river raging <app id="var1695"><lem>among the</lem></app> rocks, and the dashing of the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_095" n="79"/><app id="var1696"><lem>waterfalls around, spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear, or to
            bend before any being less almighty than that which had created</lem></app> and <app id="var1697"><lem>ruled the elements,
            here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,</lem></app> the valley
            assumed a more <app id="var1698"><lem>magnificent and astonishing character.</lem></app> Ruined castles <app id="var1699"><lem>hanging</lem></app> on the
            precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here <app id="var1700"><lem>and</lem></app> there
            peeping <app id="var1701"><lem>forth from</lem></app> among the trees, formed a scene of singular <app id="var1702"><lem>beauty.</lem></app> But it was
            augmented <app id="var1703"><lem>and</lem></app> rendered sublime by the mighty <app id="var1704"><lem>Alps,</lem></app> whose white <app id="var1705"><lem>and</lem></app> shining <app id="var1706"><lem>pyramids and</lem></app>
            domes towered above <app id="var1707"><lem>all, as belonging to</lem></app> another <app id="var1708"><lem>earth, the habitations of another race

          <p><anchor id="struct176a"/> <anchor id="struct176b"/></p>
          <p>I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened
            before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after I entered
            the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful
            and picturesque, as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and snowy
            mountains were its immediate boundaries; but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile
            fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the
            falling avalanche, and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and
            magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding <hi rend="italic">aiguilles</hi>, and its tremendous <hi rend="italic">dôme</hi> overlooked the
            valley.</p>

          <p><app id="var1709"><lem>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some
            turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days
            gone by, and were associated with the light-hearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds
            whispered in soothing accents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more. Then again the
            kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief, and indulging in
            all the</lem></app> misery of reflection. <app id="var1710"><lem>Then</lem></app> I spurred on my <app id="var1711"><lem>animal, striving so to</lem></app> forget <app id="var1712"><lem>the</lem></app>

            and threw myself on the <app id="var1716"><lem>grass,</lem></app> weighed down by horror <app id="var1717"><lem>and despair.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct178a"/>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme
            fatigue both of body and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_096" n="80"/>of mind which I had endured.
            For a short space of time I remained at the window, watching the pallid lightnings that
            played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its
            noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations:
            when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came, and
            blest the giver of oblivion. <comment text="ebb: centered underscore a few lines               below"/><anchor id="struct178b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct181a"/>I <hi rend="smallcaps">SPENT</hi> the following day roaming through the valley. I stood
            beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow
            pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills, to barricade the valley. The abrupt
            sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few
            shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
            presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves, or the fall
            of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche, or the cracking, reverberated
            along the mountains of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of
            immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
            their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation
            that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling; and
            although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some
            degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
            last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and
            ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the
            day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering
            pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine; the eagle, soaring amidst the
            clouds—they all gathered round me, and bade me be at peace.<anchor id="struct181b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1719"><lem>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? <pb xml:id="F1831_v_097" n="81"/>All
            of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain
            was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I
            even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty
            veil, and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were</lem></app> rain and <app id="var1720"><lem>storm to me? My mule
            was brought to the door, and</lem></app> I resolved <app id="var1721"><lem>to ascend</lem></app> to the summit of <app id="var1722"><lem>Montanvert.</lem></app> I
            remembered the effect <app id="var1723"><lem>that the</lem></app> view of the tremendous and <app id="var1724"><lem>ever-moving</lem></app> glacier had
            <app id="var1725"><lem>produced</lem></app> upon my mind when I first saw <app id="var1726"><lem>it. It</lem></app> had then filled me with a sublime <app id="var1727"><lem>ecstasy,</lem></app>
            that gave wings to the <app id="var1728"><lem>soul,</lem></app> and allowed <app id="var1729"><lem>it</lem></app> to soar from the <app id="var1730"><lem>obscure</lem></app> world to light <app id="var1731"><lem>and</lem></app>
            joy. The sight of the awful <app id="var1732"><lem>and</lem></app> majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of
            <app id="var1733"><lem>solemnising</lem></app> my <app id="var1734"><lem>mind, and</lem></app> causing me to forget <app id="var1735"><lem>the</lem></app> passing cares of life. I determined to

            enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically
            desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where
            trees lie broken and strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent,
            leaning upon</lem></app> the jutting <app id="var1742"><lem>rocks</lem></app> of the mountain, or <app id="var1743"><lem>transversely</lem></app> upon other trees. The

            they are <app id="var1755"><lem>sombre,</lem></app> and add an air of <app id="var1756"><lem>severity</lem></app> to the scene. I looked on the valley

          <p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat upon
            the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding
            mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.
            The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
            interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a league in width, but
            I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular
            rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance
            of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of
            the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast
            river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its
            recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My
            heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I
            exclaimed—“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds,
            allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of
            life.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct185a"/>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing
            towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I
            had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of
            man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I
            was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came
            nearer (sight tremendous and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_099" n="83"/>abhorred!) that it was the
            wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his
            approach, and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance
            bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
            ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this;
            rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm
            him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.<anchor id="struct185b"/></p>

          <p> “I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> is with considerable difficulty that I remember the
            original era of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
            A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at
            the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between
            the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed
            upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and
            troubled me; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the
            light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I believe, descended; but I presently
            found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded
            me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty,
            with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and
            more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I
            could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of
            a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This
            roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on
            the trees, or lying on the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_103" n="87"/>ground. I slaked my thirst
            at the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct197a"/>“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened, as it were
            instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a
            sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes; but these were insufficient
            to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew,
            and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and
            wept.<anchor id="struct197b"/></p>

            No distinct ideas occupied my <app id="var1926"><lem>mind;</lem></app> all was <app id="var1927"><lem>confused. I felt</lem></app> light, and <app id="var1928"><lem>hunger,</lem></app> and
            <app id="var1929"><lem>thirst,</lem></app> and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my <app id="var1930"><lem>ears,</lem></app> and on all sides various
            scents saluted <app id="var1931"><lem>me:</lem></app> the only object that I could distinguish was the <app id="var1932"><lem>bright moon, and I
            fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.</lem></app></p>

            <app id="var1943"><lem>saluted</lem></app> my <app id="var1944"><lem>ears,</lem></app> proceeded from the throats of <app id="var1945"><lem>the</lem></app> little <app id="var1946"><lem>winged animals</lem></app> who <app id="var1947"><lem>had often</lem></app>

            which <app id="var1952"><lem>canopied me. Sometimes</lem></app> I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the <app id="var1953"><lem>birds,</lem></app> but was

            sensations had, by this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day additional
            ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to perceive objects in their right
            forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and, by degrees, one herb from another.

            had placed near the heat <app id="var1978"><lem>dried,</lem></app> and itself became <app id="var1979"><lem>inflamed.</lem></app> I reflected on <app id="var1980"><lem>this; and,</lem></app> by
            touching the various <app id="var1981"><lem>branches,</lem></app> I discovered the <app id="var1982"><lem>cause,</lem></app> and busied myself in <app id="var1983"><lem>collecting</lem></app> a

            and <app id="var2003"><lem>a</lem></app> gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a <app id="var2004"><lem>flame.</lem></app> I observed this <app id="var2005"><lem>also,</lem></app> and <app id="var2006"><lem>contrived</lem></app>
            a fan of <app id="var2007"><lem>branches,</lem></app> which roused the embers when <app id="var2008"><lem>they</lem></app> were nearly extinguished. When

            the berries I <app id="var2019"><lem>gathered from the trees.</lem></app> I <app id="var2020"><lem>tried, therefore,</lem></app> to dress my food in the same

          <p><anchor id="struct204a"/>“Food, however, became scarce; and
            I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of
            hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited,
            to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In
            this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained
            through accident, and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious
            consideration of this difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
            it; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting
            sun. I passed three days in these rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A
            great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform
            white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp
            substance that covered the ground.<anchor id="struct204b"/></p>

            with great curiosity. <app id="var2031"><lem>Finding</lem></app> the door <app id="var2032"><lem>open,</lem></app> I entered. An old man sat <app id="var2033"><lem>in</lem></app> it, near a

            ground was <app id="var2049"><lem>dry;</lem></app> and <app id="var2050"><lem>it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as
            Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I
            greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread,
            cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by fatigue,
            I lay down among some straw, and fell asleep.</lem></app></p>

            hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in
            the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance;
            but, after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge
            was constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No
            wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
            although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from
            the snow and rain.</lem></app></p>

            purloined, and a cup with which I could drink, more conveniently than from my hand, of

            a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head, and bore it to
            the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man
            again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was

            instrument, began to play, and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or
            the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld
            aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager
            won my reverence, while the gentle manners</lem></app> of the <app id="var2152"><lem>girl enticed my love. He played a
            sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion,
            of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few
            sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and
            smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and
            overpowering nature: they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never
            before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from</lem></app> the

            girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and, taking some of the
            fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a
            nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed
            pleased, and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water,
            and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went
            into the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he
            had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him, and they entered the
            cottage together.</p>

            neighbours. In the evening, the young girl and her companion were employed in various
            occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument
            which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had
            finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and
            neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds: I

            possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by
            articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes, produced pleasure or
            pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a
            godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled
            in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the words
            they uttered, not having any apparent connection with</lem></app> visible <app id="var2266"><lem>objects,</lem></app> I was unable to

            <app id="var2327"><lem>that of his sister, especially</lem></app> when he addressed the old <app id="var2328"><lem>man.</lem></app></p>

            brought no wood with <app id="var2350"><lem>him. At</lem></app> other times he worked in the <app id="var2351"><lem>garden; but,</lem></app> as there was
            <app id="var2352"><lem>little</lem></app> to do in the frosty <app id="var2353"><lem>season,</lem></app> he <app id="var2354"><lem>read</lem></app> to the old man and Agatha.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct226a"/><pb xml:id="F1831_v_113" n="97"/>“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but,
            by degrees, I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read, as when
            he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which
            he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that
            possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I
            improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind
            of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily
            perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought
            not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which
            knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with
            this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>
          <p>“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate
            complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At
            first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the
            mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I
            was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did
            not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>
          <p>“As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld
            the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more employed; and the
            heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards
            found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several
            new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of
            comfort increased daily as the season advanced.</p>
          <p>“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I
            found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This frequently took
            place; but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant
            than it had been.</p>
          <p>“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During <pb xml:id="F1831_v_114" n="98"/>the
            morning, I attended the motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in
            various occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my
            friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night was
            star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.
            When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow, and
            performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these
            labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I
            heard them, on these occasions, utter the words <hi rend="italic">good spirit</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi>; but I did not then understand the signification of these
            terms.</p>
          <p>“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings
            of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable,
            and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore
            happiness to these deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the
            venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before me. I
            looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I
            formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their
            reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour
            and conciliating words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
          <p>“These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring
            the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was
            very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood
            with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose
            intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment
            than blows and execration.</p>
          <p>“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the
            earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves, dispersed
            themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultiva<pb xml:id="F1831_v_115" n="99"/>tion. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the
            trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was
            bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
            nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future
            gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.” <comment text="ebb: centered               underscore a few lines below"/></p>

          <p> “I <hi rend="smallcaps">NOW</hi> hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall
            relate events, that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me
            what I am.</p>
          <p>“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies cloudless. It
            surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most
            beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand
            scents of delight, and a thousand sights of beauty.</p>
          <p>“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old
            man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the
            countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently; and once
            his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he enquired the
            cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was
            recommencing his music, when some one tapped at the door.</p>
          <p>“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was
            dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to
            which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.
            Her voice was musical, but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,
            Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I
            beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining <pb xml:id="F1831_v_116" n="100"/>raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark,
            but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion
            wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</p>
          <p>“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished
            from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could
            hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure;
            and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by
            different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to
            Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his
            sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to
            dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation
            took place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s
            feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced her
            affectionately.</p>
          <p>“I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared
            to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, nor herself understood,
            the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her
            presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun
            dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight
            welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely
            stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he
            had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their
            countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found,
            by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that
            she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me,
            that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned
            about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them, indeed, were those which I had
            before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1831_v_117" n="101"/>“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired
            early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good
            night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the
            frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject
            of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty
            towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
          <p>“The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of
            Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his
            guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of
            sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence,
            swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods.</p>
          <p>“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She
            played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the
            wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured, and said some words,
            which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to
            express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.</p>
          <p>“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration, that joy had
            taken the place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and
            happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I
            began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>
          <p>“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks
            interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale
            radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy;
            and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
            shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun; for I never ventured abroad
            during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in
            the first village which I entered.</p>
          <p>“My days were spent in close attention, that I might <pb xml:id="F1831_v_118" n="102"/>more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than
            the Arabian, who understood very little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I
            comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.</p>
          <p>“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters, as it was taught to
            the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.</p>
          <p>“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s ‘Ruins of Empires.’ I should
            not have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in reading it, given very
            minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was
            framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory
            knowledge of history, and a view of the several empires at present existing in the
            world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the
            different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous
            genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the
            early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire; of
            chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere,
            and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.</p>
          <p>“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once
            so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one
            time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at another, as all that can be conceived of
            noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can
            befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared
            the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless
            worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his
            fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice
            and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and loathing.</p>
          <p>“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new <pb xml:id="F1831_v_119" n="103"/>wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the
            Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the
            division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble
            blood.</p>
          <p>“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most
            esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and unsullied descent united with riches. A
            man might be respected with only one of these advantages; but, without either, he was
            considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste
            his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator
            I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of
            property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was
            not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon
            coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my
            stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around, I saw and heard of none like me. Was
            I then a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled, and whom all men
            disowned?</p>
          <p>“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me: I tried
            to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever
            remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst,
            and heat!</p>
          <p>“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized
            on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and
            feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain,
            and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and
            good feelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I
            was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by
            stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the
            desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of <pb xml:id="F1831_v_120" n="104"/>Agatha, and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian,
            were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of
            the loved Felix, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>
          <p>“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the difference of
            sexes; and the birth and growth of children; how the father doated on the smiles of the
            infant, and the lively sallies of the older child; how all the life and cares of the
            mother were wrapped up in the precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained
            knowledge; of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human
            being to another in mutual bonds.</p>
          <p>“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no
            mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now
            a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I
            had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling
            me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again recurred, to
            be answered only with groans.</p>
          <p>“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to return to the
            cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and
            wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for
            so I loved, in an innocent, half painful self-deceit, to call them).</p><comment text="ebb:               centered underscore a few lines below"/>

            respected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service
            of his country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few
            months before my arrival, they had lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris,

          <p><anchor id="struct232a"/>“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of
            Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise <pb xml:id="F1831_v_122" n="106"/>of her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be
            conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer; yet he
            looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his

          <p>“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of
            the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this
            lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the
            aid of an old man, a servant of her father, who understood French. She thanked him in
            the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent; and at the same time
            she gently deplored her own fate.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct233a"/>“I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in the hovel,
            to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix

            many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister,
            and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit
            by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his

            Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into
            some part of the Turkish dominions.</p>
          <p>“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before
            which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and
            Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed
            the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
            affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and
            sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her

          <p>“The pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, re<pb xml:id="F1831_v_135" n="119"/>stored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the
            cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. I had
            certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the
            father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his
            children. I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have
            discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my
            approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable; and, after much
            consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my
            representations win him to my party.<anchor id="struct279b"/></p>

            mounted high in the <app id="var2925"><lem>heavens,</lem></app> but the cottagers did not <app id="var2926"><lem>appear.</lem></app> I trembled violently,
            apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was <app id="var2927"><lem>dark, and</lem></app> I heard
            no <app id="var2928"><lem>motion;</lem></app> I cannot describe the agony <app id="var2929"><lem>of</lem></app> this suspense.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct283a"/>“Presently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they entered into
            conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as
            they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors. Soon
            after, however, Felix approached with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that he
            had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover, from his
            discourse, the meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>
          <p>“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him, ‘that <pb xml:id="F1831_v_136" n="120"/>you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent, and to lose the produce of your garden?
            I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some
            days to consider of your determination.’<anchor id="struct283b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct284a"/> <anchor id="struct284b"/></p>
          <p>“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage. The
            life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I
            have related. My wife and my sister will never recover their horror. I entreat you not
            to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this
            place.’</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct285a"/>“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in
            which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family
            of De Lacey more.</p>
          <p>“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid
            despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only link that held me to the
            world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did
            not strive to control them; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent
            my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De
            Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these
            thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again, when I reflected
            that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to
            injure any thing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced, I
            placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and, after having destroyed every
            vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had
            sunk to commence my operations.<anchor id="struct285b"/></p>

            I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful
            of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun
            became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; <pb xml:id="F1831_v_138" n="122"/>the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare,
            and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my
            being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and
            bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the
            spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened; but I
            rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the
            country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no
            respite: no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food;
            but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the
            sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an
            especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.<anchor id="struct290b"/></p>

            was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches,
            now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to
            pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the
            shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot
            where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued her
            course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she
            fell into the rapid <pb xml:id="F1831_v_139" n="123"/>stream. I rushed from my
            hiding-place; and, with extreme labour from the force of the current, saved her, and
            dragged her to shore. She was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power,
            to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who
            was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted
            towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the
            wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he
            aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my

          <p>“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the
            murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to
            me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young: not indeed so
            beautiful as her whose portrait I held; but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in the
            loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting
            smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over her, and whispered “Awake,
            fairest, thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of
            affection from thine eyes: my beloved, awake!”</p>
          <p>“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and
            see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act, if her
            darkened eyes opened, and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend
            within me—not I, but she shall suffer: the murder I have committed because I am for ever
            robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her:
            be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I
            had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her, and placed the portrait securely in
            one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.<anchor id="struct300b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct312a"/>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various arguments which he
            had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening
            of his existence, and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and
            scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not
            omitted in my calculations: a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers,
            and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being
            possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I
            concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I
            should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said—</p>
          <p>“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other
            place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female

          <p>“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of Heaven, and by the fire of

            I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of <app id="var3182"><lem>an eagle,</lem></app> and

            darkness.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct315a"/>These were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the eternal
            twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened to every blast of wind, as if
            it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.</p>
          <p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but
            returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my
            sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain’s weight, and their excess destroyed my
            agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to
            the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm; but I answered no
              ques<pb xml:id="F1831_v_147" n="131"/>tion, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were
            placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might
            I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save
            them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an
            occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream; and
            that thought only had to me the reality of life.</p><comment text="ebb: centered underscore a few               lines below"/>

            vengeance of the disappointed <app id="var3217"><lem>fiend,</lem></app> yet I <app id="var3218"><lem>was unable to overcome my repugnance to the
            task which was enjoined me. I found that I could</lem></app> not <app id="var3219"><lem>compose a female without again
            devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of
            some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
            material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to
            visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and shrunk from
            taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less
            absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me: my health,</lem></app> which had hitherto
            <app id="var3220"><lem>declined,</lem></app> was now much <app id="var3221"><lem>restored; and</lem></app> my <app id="var3222"><lem>spirits,</lem></app> when unchecked by the memory of my
            unhappy promise, rose <app id="var3223"><lem>proportionably.</lem></app> My father saw this <app id="var3224"><lem>change with pleasure,</lem></app> and he
            turned his thoughts towards the best <app id="var3225"><lem>method</lem></app> of eradicating the remains of my <app id="var3226"><lem>melancholy,</lem></app>
            which every now and then would return by <app id="var3227"><lem>fits, and</lem></app> with a devouring blackness <app id="var3228"><lem>overcast</lem></app>
            the approaching <app id="var3229"><lem>sunshine.</lem></app> At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect <app id="var3230"><lem>solitude.</lem></app> I
            passed whole days on the lake <app id="var3231"><lem>alone in a little boat, watching</lem></app> the <app id="var3232"><lem>clouds, and</lem></app> listening
            to the <app id="var3233"><lem>rippling</lem></app> of the waves, silent <app id="var3234"><lem>and</lem></app> listless. But the fresh air and bright sun
            seldom failed to restore me to some degree <pb xml:id="F1831_v_148" n="132"/>of
            <app id="var3235"><lem>composure; and,</lem></app> on my <app id="var3236"><lem>return,</lem></app> I met the <app id="var3237"><lem>salutations</lem></app> of my friends with a readier <app id="var3238"><lem>smile
            and</lem></app> a more cheerful <app id="var3239"><lem>heart.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct317a"/>It was after my return from one of these rambles, that my father, calling me aside,
            thus addressed me:—</p>
          <p>“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and
            seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our
            society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday
            an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such
            a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”</p>
          <p>I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—<anchor id="struct317b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct318a"/> <anchor id="struct318b"/></p>
          <p>“I <app id="var3240"><lem>confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear
            Elizabeth</lem></app> as the tie of our domestic <app id="var3241"><lem>comfort, and</lem></app> the stay of my declining years. <app id="var3242"><lem>You</lem></app>
            were attached to <app id="var3243"><lem>each</lem></app> other from your earliest infancy; <app id="var3244"><lem>you</lem></app> studied <app id="var3245"><lem>together,</lem></app> and

            the <app id="var3249"><lem>experience</lem></app> of <app id="var3250"><lem>man,</lem></app> that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my <app id="var3251"><lem>plan,</lem></app> may
            have entirely destroyed <app id="var3252"><lem>it. You, perhaps,</lem></app> regard her as your <app id="var3253"><lem>sister,</lem></app> without any wish
            that she might become your wife. <app id="var3254"><lem>Nay,</lem></app> you may have met with another whom you may <app id="var3255"><lem>love;

            the poignant misery <app id="var3259"><lem>which you</lem></app> appear to <app id="var3260"><lem>feel.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct319a"/>“My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never
            saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My
            future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”<anchor id="struct319b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct322a"/>I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering
            any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to
            arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth
            was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not yet
            fulfilled, and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend
            over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet
            hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my engagement, and
            let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an
            union from which I expected peace.<anchor id="struct322b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct323a"/> <anchor id="struct323b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3282"><lem>I</lem></app> remembered also the necessity <app id="var3283"><lem>imposed upon me</lem></app> of either <app id="var3284"><lem>journeying</lem></app> to <app id="var3285"><lem>England,</lem></app> or
            entering into a long correspondence with <app id="var3286"><lem>those</lem></app> philosophers of that <app id="var3287"><lem>country,</lem></app> whose
            knowledge and <app id="var3288"><lem>discoveries</lem></app> were of <app id="var3289"><lem>indispensable</lem></app> use <app id="var3290"><lem>to</lem></app> me <app id="var3291"><lem>in</lem></app> my present <app id="var3292"><lem>undertaking.</lem></app> The
            latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was <app id="var3293"><lem>dilatory</lem></app> and <app id="var3294"><lem>unsatisfactory:
            besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome
            task in my father’s house, while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I
            knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest</lem></app> of <app id="var3295"><lem>which would
            disclose a tale</lem></app> to <app id="var3296"><lem>thrill all connected with me with horror.</lem></app> I was <app id="var3297"><lem>aware also that I
            should often lose all self-command, all capacity</lem></app> of <app id="var3298"><lem>hiding the harrowing sensations that
            would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself</lem></app>
            from <app id="var3299"><lem>all I loved while thus employed. Once <pb xml:id="F1831_v_150" n="134"/>commenced,
            it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored</lem></app> to <app id="var3300"><lem>my family in peace and
            happiness. My promise</lem></app> fulfilled, <app id="var3301"><lem>the</lem></app> monster <app id="var3302"><lem>would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy
            imaged)</lem></app> some <app id="var3303"><lem>accident</lem></app> might <app id="var3304"><lem>meanwhile occur</lem></app> to destroy <app id="var3305"><lem>him,</lem></app> and put an <app id="var3306"><lem>end</lem></app> to my slavery
            for <app id="var3307"><lem>ever.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct324a"/>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England;
            but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise
            which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily
            induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy, that
            resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable
            of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and
            varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.</p>
          <p>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year,
            was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my
            having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with
            Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with the
            solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey
            the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that
            thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might
            stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times
            force his abhorred presence on me, to remind me of my task, or to contemplate its
            progress?</p>
          <p>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth
            should take place immediately on my return. My father’s age rendered him extremely
            averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested
            toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day
            when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth, and forget the
            past in my union with her.<anchor id="struct324b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3308"><lem>I</lem></app> now <app id="var3309"><lem>made</lem></app> arrangements for my <app id="var3310"><lem>journey;</lem></app> but one <pb xml:id="F1831_v_151" n="135"/>feeling haunted <app id="var3311"><lem>me,</lem></app> which filled <app id="var3312"><lem>me</lem></app> with fear and agitation. During my absence I
            should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected
            from his attacks, <app id="var3313"><lem>exasperated</lem></app> as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to
            follow me wherever I might <app id="var3314"><lem>go;</lem></app> and would he not <app id="var3315"><lem>accompany</lem></app> me to England? This
            <app id="var3316"><lem>imagination</lem></app> was dreadful in <app id="var3317"><lem>itself,</lem></app> but <app id="var3318"><lem>soothing, inasmuch</lem></app> as <app id="var3319"><lem>it</lem></app> supposed the safety of
            my <app id="var3320"><lem>friends.</lem></app> I was <app id="var3321"><lem>agonised with</lem></app> the idea of <app id="var3322"><lem>the</lem></app> possibility that the reverse of this
            might happen. <app id="var3323"><lem>But</lem></app> through the whole period during which I was the slave of my <app id="var3324"><lem>creature,</lem></app>
            I allowed myself to be <app id="var3325"><lem>governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations
            strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family from the danger
            of his machinations.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct326a"/>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My
            journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth, therefore, acquiesced: but she was
            filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery
            and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man
            is blind to a thousand minute circumstances, which call forth a woman’s sedulous
            attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return,—a thousand conflicting emotions
            rendered her mute, as she bade me a tearful silent farewell.</p>
          <p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I
            was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a
            bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be
            packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful
            and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the
            bourne of my travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.<anchor id="struct326b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3326"><lem>After</lem></app> some days <app id="var3327"><lem>spent</lem></app> in listless <app id="var3328"><lem>indolence,</lem></app> during which I <app id="var3329"><lem>traversed</lem></app> many <app id="var3330"><lem>leagues,</lem></app> I
            arrived at <app id="var3331"><lem>Strasburgh,</lem></app> where I waited two days for Clerval. He <app id="var3332"><lem>came. Alas,</lem></app> how great was
            the contrast between <app id="var3333"><lem>us!</lem></app> He was alive to every new scene; joyful when he saw the

            <app id="var3335"><lem>beheld</lem></app> it <app id="var3336"><lem>rise, and</lem></app> recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours <app id="var3337"><lem>of</lem></app>
            the <app id="var3338"><lem>landscape, and</lem></app> the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried,

            <app id="var3373"><lem>beneath; and,</lem></app> on the sudden turn of a <app id="var3374"><lem>promontory, flourishing vineyards,</lem></app> with green
            sloping <app id="var3375"><lem>banks, and</lem></app> a meandering <app id="var3376"><lem>river, and populous towns occupy the scene.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var3377"><lem>We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the labourers, as we
            glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated
            by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed
            on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been
            a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as
            if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and</lem></app> enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.
            “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful <pb xml:id="F1831_v_153" n="137"/>scenes of
            my own <app id="var3378"><lem>country;</lem></app> I have <app id="var3379"><lem>visited</lem></app> the lakes of Lucerne <app id="var3380"><lem>and Uri,</lem></app> where the snowy mountains
            descend <app id="var3381"><lem>almost</lem></app> perpendicularly to the <app id="var3382"><lem>water,</lem></app> casting black <app id="var3383"><lem>and</lem></app> impenetrable <app id="var3384"><lem>shades,</lem></app>
            which <app id="var3385"><lem>would</lem></app> cause a gloomy <app id="var3386"><lem>and</lem></app> mournful <app id="var3387"><lem>appearance,</lem></app> were it not for the most verdant
            islands that relieve the eye by their gay <app id="var3388"><lem>appearance;</lem></app> I have seen this lake agitated by
            a <app id="var3389"><lem>tempest,</lem></app> when the wind tore up whirlwinds of <app id="var3390"><lem>water,</lem></app> and gave you an idea of what the
            <app id="var3391"><lem>water-spout</lem></app> must be on the great <app id="var3392"><lem>ocean; and</lem></app> the waves dash with fury <app id="var3393"><lem>the</lem></app> base of the
            <app id="var3394"><lem>mountain,</lem></app> where the priest <app id="var3395"><lem>and</lem></app> his mistress were overwhelmed by an <app id="var3396"><lem>avalanche, and</lem></app> where
            their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the <app id="var3397"><lem>nightly wind;</lem></app> I
            have seen the <app id="var3398"><lem>mountains</lem></app> of <app id="var3399"><lem>La Valais, and</lem></app> the <app id="var3400"><lem>Pays</lem></app> de <app id="var3401"><lem>Vaud: but</lem></app> this country, Victor,
            pleases me more than all those wonders. The <app id="var3402"><lem>mountains</lem></app> of Switzerland are more majestic
            <app id="var3403"><lem>and strange;</lem></app> but there is a charm in the banks of this divine <app id="var3404"><lem>river,</lem></app> that I never before
            saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs <app id="var3405"><lem>yon precipice;</lem></app> and that also on the
            <app id="var3406"><lem>island,</lem></app> almost concealed <app id="var3407"><lem>amongst</lem></app> the foliage of those lovely <app id="var3408"><lem>trees; and now that group
            of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of
            the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more
            in harmony with man, than those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible
            peaks of the mountains of our own country.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct330a"/>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words, and to dwell on
            the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the
              <quote>“very poetry of nature.”</quote> His wild and enthusiastic imagination was
            chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections,
            and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach
            us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
            satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with
            admiration, he loved with ardour:— <pb xml:id="F1831_v_154" n="138"/><cit><quote><lg><l>————————————“The sounding cataract</l>
                  <l>Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,</l>
                  <l>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</l>
                  <l>Their colours and their forms, were then to him</l>
                  <l>An appetite; a feeling, and a love,</l>
                  <l>That had no need of a remoter charm,</l>
                  <l>By thought supplied, or any interest</l>
                  <l>Unborrow’d from the eye*.”</l></lg></quote><note>* <bibl>Wordsworth’s Tintern
                  Abbey.</bibl></note></cit></p>
          <p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? Has this
            mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a
            world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does
            it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
            beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy
            friend.</p>
          <p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the
            unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which
            his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale.<anchor id="struct330b"/></p>

          <p>L<hi rend="smallcaps">ONDON</hi> was our present point of rest; we determined to remain
            several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of
            the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a
            secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information
            necessary for the completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of
            introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural
            philosophers.<anchor id="struct333b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3429"><lem>If</lem></app> this journey had taken place during my days of study <app id="var3430"><lem>and happiness,</lem></app> it would have
            afforded me inexpressible <app id="var3431"><lem>pleasure.</lem></app> But a blight had come over my <app id="var3432"><lem>existence, and</lem></app> I only
            visited these people for the sake of the information they might <app id="var3433"><lem>give</lem></app> me on the subject
            in which <app id="var3434"><lem>my interest</lem></app> was so <app id="var3435"><lem>terribly profound.</lem></app> Company was <app id="var3436"><lem>irksome</lem></app> to me; when <app id="var3437"><lem>alone,</lem></app> I
            could fill my mind with the sights of heaven <app id="var3438"><lem>and</lem></app> earth; the voice of <app id="var3439"><lem>Henry</lem></app> soothed <app id="var3440"><lem>me,

            faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable <app id="var3443"><lem>barrier</lem></app> placed between
            me <app id="var3444"><lem>and</lem></app> my <app id="var3445"><lem>fellow-men; this</lem></app> barrier was sealed with the blood of William and <app id="var3446"><lem>Justine;</lem></app> and
            to reflect on <app id="var3447"><lem>the</lem></app> events <app id="var3448"><lem>connected with those names filled</lem></app> my soul with <app id="var3449"><lem>anguish.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var3450"><lem>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive, and anxious to</lem></app>
            gain experience <app id="var3451"><lem>and instruction.</lem></app> The difference of manners <app id="var3452"><lem>which</lem></app> he observed was to him
            <app id="var3453"><lem>an</lem></app> inexhaustible source of <app id="var3454"><lem>instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he
            had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his
            knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the
            means of materially assisting the progress of European colonisation and trade. In
            Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. He</lem></app> was for ever <app id="var3455"><lem>busy; and</lem></app> the
            only check to his enjoyments was my <app id="var3456"><lem>sorrowful and</lem></app> dejected <app id="var3457"><lem>mind.</lem></app> I tried to conceal this
            as much as <app id="var3458"><lem>possible,</lem></app> that I might not debar him from the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_156" n="140"/>pleasures natural to <app id="var3459"><lem>one,</lem></app> who was entering on a new scene of life,
            undisturbed by any care or <app id="var3460"><lem>bitter</lem></app> recollection. I often refused to accompany <app id="var3461"><lem>him,
            alleging</lem></app> another <app id="var3462"><lem>engagement,</lem></app> that I might remain <app id="var3463"><lem>alone.</lem></app> I now also began to collect the
            materials necessary for my <app id="var3464"><lem>new creation, and</lem></app> this was <app id="var3465"><lem>to</lem></app> me like the torture of single
            drops of water continually falling on the <app id="var3466"><lem>head.</lem></app> Every thought that was devoted to it was
            <app id="var3467"><lem>an</lem></app> extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to
            <app id="var3468"><lem>quiver, and</lem></app> my heart to <app id="var3469"><lem>palpitate.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct336a"/>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland,
            who had formerly been our visiter at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native
            country, and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong
            our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept
            this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and
            streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
            dwelling-places.<anchor id="struct336b"/></p>

          <p>We had arrived in <app id="var3470"><lem>England</lem></app> at the beginning of <app id="var3471"><lem>October,</lem></app> and it was now <app id="var3472"><lem>February. We
            accordingly</lem></app> determined to commence our journey towards the north <app id="var3473"><lem>at</lem></app> the expiration of
            another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to
            <app id="var3474"><lem>Edinburgh, but</lem></app> to visit Windsor, Oxford, <app id="var3475"><lem>Matlock, and</lem></app> the Cumberland <app id="var3476"><lem>lakes,</lem></app> resolving to
            arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed <app id="var3477"><lem>up my</lem></app> chemical
            <app id="var3478"><lem>instruments, and</lem></app> the materials <app id="var3479"><lem>I</lem></app> had <app id="var3480"><lem>collected, resolving</lem></app> to finish my labours in some
            obscure nook in the <app id="var3481"><lem>northern highlands</lem></app> of <app id="var3482"><lem>Scotland.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct338a"/>We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in
            its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the
            quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us.<anchor id="struct338b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct339a"/> <anchor id="struct339b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3483"><lem>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our</lem></app> minds <app id="var3484"><lem>were</lem></app> filled with
            the remembrance of <app id="var3485"><lem>the</lem></app> events that had been transacted <app id="var3486"><lem>there more than</lem></app> a <app id="var3487"><lem>century and</lem></app> a
            half before. It was here that Charles <app id="var3488"><lem>I.</lem></app> had collected his <app id="var3489"><lem>forces. This city</lem></app> had
            <app id="var3490"><lem>remained</lem></app> faithful to <pb xml:id="F1831_v_157" n="141"/><app id="var3491"><lem>him, after</lem></app> the whole nation had
            forsaken <app id="var3492"><lem>his cause</lem></app> to join the standard of parliament <app id="var3493"><lem>and</lem></app> liberty. <app id="var3494"><lem>The memory of that
            unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable Falkland,</lem></app> the <app id="var3495"><lem>insolent Goring, his
            queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be
            supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we
            delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary
            gratification, the appearance</lem></app> of the <app id="var3496"><lem>city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain
            our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
            magnificent;</lem></app> and the <app id="var3497"><lem>lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite
            verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse</lem></app> of <app id="var3498"><lem>waters, which reflects its majestic
            assemblage</lem></app> of <app id="var3499"><lem>towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct340a"/>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the
            past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my
            youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of
            what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart,
            and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered
            my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to
            be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and intolerable to
            myself.</p>
          <p>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and
            endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of
            English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive
            objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and
            the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its
            debasing and miserable fears, to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and
            self-sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an
            instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a free and lofty spirit;
            but the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_158" n="142"/>iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank
            again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.<anchor id="struct340b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct341a"/> <anchor id="struct341b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3500"><lem>We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest.
            The country in</lem></app> the <app id="var3501"><lem>neighbourhood</lem></app> of <app id="var3502"><lem>this village resembled,</lem></app> to <app id="var3503"><lem>a greater degree,</lem></app> the
            scenery of Switzerland; <app id="var3504"><lem>but</lem></app> every thing is on a lower <app id="var3505"><lem>scale, and</lem></app> the green <app id="var3506"><lem>hills</lem></app> want
            the <app id="var3507"><lem>crown</lem></app> of distant white <app id="var3508"><lem>Alps,</lem></app> which always attend on the piny <app id="var3509"><lem>mountains</lem></app> of <app id="var3510"><lem>my native</lem></app>
            country. We visited the wondrous <app id="var3511"><lem>cave, and</lem></app> the little cabinets of natural <app id="var3512"><lem>history,</lem></app> where
            the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox <app id="var3513"><lem>and
            Chamounix.</lem></app> The latter <app id="var3514"><lem>name</lem></app> made me <app id="var3515"><lem>tremble,</lem></app> when pronounced by <app id="var3516"><lem>Henry; and</lem></app> I hastened to
            quit <app id="var3517"><lem>Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct342a"/>From Derby, still journeying northward, we passed two months in Cumberland and
            Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little
            patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes,
            and the dashing of the rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also
            we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight
            of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men
            of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could

            an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our
            Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not
            sorry. I had now neglected <pb xml:id="F1831_v_159" n="143"/>my promise for some time,
            and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland,
            and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every
            moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my
            letters with feverish impatience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and</lem></app> overcome by
            a thousand fears; <app id="var3530"><lem>and</lem></app> when they <app id="var3531"><lem>arrived,</lem></app> and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my

            <app id="var3540"><lem>shadow,</lem></app> to protect him from <app id="var3541"><lem>the</lem></app> fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had

          <p><anchor id="struct346a"/>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested
            the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford: for the antiquity
            of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the beauty and regularity of the new
            town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle, and its environs, the most delightful in the
            world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for
            the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to

            from a <app id="var3550"><lem>guest;</lem></app> and accordingly I told <app id="var3551"><lem>Clerval</lem></app> that I wished to make the tour of Scotland

          <p><anchor id="struct348a"/><pb xml:id="F1831_v_160" n="144"/>Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on
            this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with
            you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not
            know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at

          <p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland, and
            finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monster followed me, and would
            discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his

          <p><app id="var3564"><lem>With</lem></app> this resolution I traversed the northern <app id="var3565"><lem>highlands,</lem></app> and fixed on one of the

            limbs gave tokens of their <app id="var3577"><lem>miserable</lem></app> fare. <app id="var3578"><lem>Vegetables and</lem></app> bread, when they indulged in
            such luxuries, <app id="var3579"><lem>and</lem></app> even fresh <app id="var3580"><lem>water,</lem></app> was to be procured from the main <app id="var3581"><lem>land,</lem></app> which was
            about five miles distant.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct350a"/>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant
            when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the
            squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were
            unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
            furniture, and took possession; an incident which would, doubtless, have occasioned some
            surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid
            poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance
            of food and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest
            sensations of men.<anchor id="struct350b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct352a"/>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but, as I proceeded
            in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not
            prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days; and at other times I toiled
            day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I
            was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to
            the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my
            labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in

          <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
          <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">SAT</hi> one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the
            moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I
            remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the
            night, or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of
            reflection occurred to me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.
            Three years before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend whose
            unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart, and filled it for ever with the bitterest
            remorse. I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I was alike
            ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate, and delight,
            for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of
            man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in all probability was
            to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made
            before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
            loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it
            came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to
            the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by
            the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.<anchor id="struct354b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3618"><lem>Even if they were to leave Europe,</lem></app> and <app id="var3619"><lem>inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of</lem></app>
            the <app id="var3620"><lem>first results</lem></app> of <app id="var3621"><lem>those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would</lem></app> be <app id="var3622"><lem>children,
            and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth, who might make the very
            existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had</lem></app> I <app id="var3623"><lem>right,</lem></app>
            for my own <app id="var3624"><lem>benefit,</lem></app> to inflict this curse <app id="var3625"><lem>upon</lem></app> everlasting generations? I had before
            been moved by the sophisms of the being <app id="var3626"><lem>I</lem></app> had created; I had been <app id="var3627"><lem>struck senseless</lem></app> by
            his <pb xml:id="F1831_v_163" n="147"/>fiendish <app id="var3628"><lem>threats: but now,</lem></app> for the first <app id="var3629"><lem>time,</lem></app> the
            wickedness <app id="var3630"><lem>of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might
            curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the
            price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct356a"/> <anchor id="struct356b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3631"><lem>I</lem></app> trembled, and my heart failed <app id="var3632"><lem>within me; when,</lem></app> on looking <app id="var3633"><lem>up,</lem></app> I <app id="var3634"><lem>saw,</lem></app> by the light of

            where I <app id="var3638"><lem>sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.</lem></app> Yes, he had followed me in
            my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in <app id="var3639"><lem>caves,</lem></app> or taken refuge in wide
            <app id="var3640"><lem>and desert heaths; and</lem></app> he now came to <app id="var3641"><lem>mark</lem></app> my <app id="var3642"><lem>progress,</lem></app> <app id="var3643"><lem>and claim the fulfilment</lem></app> of <app id="var3644"><lem>my
            promise.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct357a"/>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and
            treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like
            to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The
            wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness,
            and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.</p>
          <p>I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to
            resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was
            alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the sickening
            oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
          <p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost
            motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet
            moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze
            wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
            although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly
            arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my
            house.<anchor id="struct357b"/></p>

              <pb xml:id="F1831_v_164" n="148"/>wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a
            cottage not far from <app id="var3649"><lem>mine; but</lem></app> I was overcome by the <app id="var3650"><lem>sensation of helplessness,</lem></app> so often

          <p>“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? Do you dare
            to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery: I left Switzerland with you; I

          <p>“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in
            deformity and wickedness.”</p>
          <p>“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my
            condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can

            sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s

            one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from
            Clerval, entreating me to join him. He said that he was wearing away his time
            fruitlessly where he was; that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired
            his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise.
            He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be
            followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to
            bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to
            leave my solitary isle, and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards
            together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my

          <p><anchor id="struct370a"/>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket
            aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was
            perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from
            them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with
            shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow-creatures. At <pb xml:id="F1831_v_168" n="152"/>one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a
            thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the
            sea: I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the spot.
            The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the north-east breeze
            that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with such agreeable sensations,
            that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water; and, fixing the rudder in a direct
            position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, every thing
            was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut through the waves;
            the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.</p>
          <p>I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the
            sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves continually
            threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was north-east, and must
            have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my
            course, but quickly found that, if I again made the attempt, the boat would be instantly
            filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I
            confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me, and was so
            slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world, that the sun was of
            little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic, and feel all the
            tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and
            buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning
            thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by
            clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea,
            it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought
            of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; all left behind, on whom the monster might
            satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie, so
            despairing and frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing
            before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.<anchor id="struct370b"/></p>

            produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke

            <app id="var3828"><lem>faces</lem></app> expressed a mixture of <app id="var3829"><lem>curiosity and anger,</lem></app> which <app id="var3830"><lem>annoyed, and in some</lem></app> degree
            alarmed me. I enquired the way to the <app id="var3831"><lem>inn;</lem></app> but no one <app id="var3832"><lem>replied.</lem></app> I then moved <app id="var3833"><lem>forward,</lem></app> and
            a <app id="var3834"><lem>murmuring sound arose</lem></app> from the <app id="var3835"><lem>crowd</lem></app> as they followed <app id="var3836"><lem>and</lem></app> surrounded <app id="var3837"><lem>me;</lem></app> when an
            <app id="var3838"><lem>ill-looking man approaching,</lem></app> tapped me on the <app id="var3839"><lem>shoulder, and said,</lem></app> “Come, <app id="var3840"><lem>Sir, you</lem></app> must
            follow me to Mr. <app id="var3841"><lem>Kirwin’s,</lem></app> to give an account of <app id="var3842"><lem>yourself.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct376a"/>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free
            country?”</p>
          <p>“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate; and you are to give
            an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”<anchor id="struct376b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct377a"/> <anchor id="struct377b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3843"><lem>This</lem></app> answer startled <app id="var3844"><lem>me; but</lem></app> I presently recovered myself. I was <app id="var3845"><lem>innocent;</lem></app> that could
            easily be <app id="var3846"><lem>proved:</lem></app> accordingly I followed my <app id="var3847"><lem>conductor</lem></app> in <app id="var3848"><lem>silence, and</lem></app> was led to <app id="var3849"><lem>one of</lem></app>
            the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue <app id="var3850"><lem>and hunger; but, being</lem></app>
            surrounded by a <app id="var3851"><lem>crowd,</lem></app> I thought it politic to rouse all my <app id="var3852"><lem>strength,</lem></app> that no physical
            debility might be construed into apprehension <app id="var3853"><lem>or conscious</lem></app> guilt. Little did I then
            expect the calamity that <app id="var3854"><lem>was</lem></app> in a few moments <app id="var3855"><lem>to overwhelm</lem></app> me, and <app id="var3856"><lem>extinguish</lem></app> in horror

          <p>I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the
            frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.</p>

          <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">WAS</hi> soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an
            old benevolent man, with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some
            degree of severity: and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as
            witnesses on this occasion.<anchor id="struct378b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct379a"/> <anchor id="struct379b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3860"><lem>About</lem></app> half a dozen men came <app id="var3861"><lem>forward; and,</lem></app> one being selected by the <app id="var3862"><lem>magistrate,</lem></app> he
            <app id="var3863"><lem>deposed,</lem></app> that he had been out fishing the night before with his son <app id="var3864"><lem>and</lem></app> brother-in-law,
            Daniel Nugent, <app id="var3865"><lem>when,</lem></app> about <app id="var3866"><lem>ten o’clock,</lem></app> they observed a strong northerly blast <app id="var3867"><lem>rising,
            and</lem></app> they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark <app id="var3868"><lem>night,</lem></app> as the moon had not yet
            risen; <app id="var3869"><lem>they</lem></app> did not <app id="var3870"><lem>land</lem></app> at the <app id="var3871"><lem>harbour,</lem></app> but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek
            about two miles below. He <app id="var3872"><lem>walked on first,</lem></app> carrying a part of the fishing <app id="var3873"><lem>tackle, and</lem></app>
            his companions followed him at some distance. As he was <app id="var3874"><lem>proceeding</lem></app> along the <app id="var3875"><lem>sands,</lem></app> he
            <app id="var3876"><lem>struck</lem></app> his foot against <app id="var3877"><lem>something, and</lem></app> fell <app id="var3878"><lem>at</lem></app> his length on the <app id="var3879"><lem>ground. His companions</lem></app>
            came up to assist <app id="var3880"><lem>him; and,</lem></app> by the light of their <app id="var3881"><lem>lantern,</lem></app> they <app id="var3882"><lem>found</lem></app> that he had fallen
            on the body of a <app id="var3883"><lem>man,</lem></app> who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition <app id="var3884"><lem>was,</lem></app> that
            it was the corpse of <app id="var3885"><lem>some</lem></app> person who had been <app id="var3886"><lem>drowned, and was</lem></app> thrown on shore by the
            <app id="var3887"><lem>waves; but, on examination,</lem></app> they found that the clothes were not <app id="var3888"><lem>wet, and</lem></app> even that the
            body was not <app id="var3889"><lem>then</lem></app> cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near
            the <app id="var3890"><lem>spot, and endeavoured,</lem></app> but in <app id="var3891"><lem>vain,</lem></app> to restore it to <app id="var3892"><lem>life. It appeared to be a
            handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been
            strangled; for there was no sign of any violence, except the black mark of fingers on
            his neck.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct380a"/>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but when the mark
            of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of my brother, and felt myself
            extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to
            lean on a chair <pb xml:id="F1831_v_172" n="156"/>for support. The magistrate observed
            me with a keen eye, and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.</p>
          <p>The son confirmed his father’s account: but when Daniel Nugent was called, he swore
            positively that, just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man
            in it, at a short distance from the shore; and, as far as he could judge by the light of
            a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.<anchor id="struct380b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct381a"/> <anchor id="struct381b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3893"><lem>A</lem></app> woman <app id="var3894"><lem>deposed,</lem></app> that she lived near the <app id="var3895"><lem>beach, and</lem></app> was standing at the door of her
            <app id="var3896"><lem>cottage,</lem></app> waiting for the return <app id="var3897"><lem>of the fishermen, about</lem></app> an hour before she heard of the
            <app id="var3898"><lem>discovery</lem></app> of the <app id="var3899"><lem>body, when</lem></app> she saw a <app id="var3900"><lem>boat,</lem></app> with only one <app id="var3901"><lem>man</lem></app> in <app id="var3902"><lem>it,</lem></app> push off from that
            part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards <app id="var3903"><lem>found.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct382a"/>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her
            house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed it; and Daniel went to the
            town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.</p>
          <p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed, that, with the
            strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had
            beaten about for many hours, and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from
            which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the
            body from another place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the shore,
            I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of * * * from the
            place where I had deposited the corpse.<anchor id="struct382b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct383a"/> <anchor id="struct383b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3904"><lem>Mr. Kirwin,</lem></app> on hearing this <app id="var3905"><lem>evidence,</lem></app> desired that I should be taken into the room
            where the body lay for <app id="var3906"><lem>interment,</lem></app> that it might be observed what effect the sight of it
            would <app id="var3907"><lem>produce</lem></app> upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had
            exhibited <app id="var3908"><lem>when</lem></app> the mode of the murder had been <app id="var3909"><lem>described.</lem></app> I was <app id="var3910"><lem>accordingly conducted,</lem></app>
            by the <app id="var3911"><lem>magistrate and</lem></app> several other <app id="var3912"><lem>persons,</lem></app> to the <app id="var3913"><lem>inn.</lem></app> I could not help being struck
            by the strange <app id="var3914"><lem>coincidences</lem></app> that had taken place during this eventful <app id="var3915"><lem>night; but,</lem></app>
            knowing that I had been <app id="var3916"><lem>conversing</lem></app> with several persons in <pb xml:id="F1831_v_173" n="157"/>the island I had inhabited about the time that the body <app id="var3917"><lem>had been found, I was
            perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct384a"/> <anchor id="struct384b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3918"><lem>I</lem></app> entered the room where the <app id="var3919"><lem>corpse lay, and</lem></app> was led up to the coffin. How can I
            <app id="var3920"><lem>describe</lem></app> my <app id="var3921"><lem>sensations on beholding it?</lem></app> I feel yet parched with <app id="var3922"><lem>horror,</lem></app> nor can I
            <app id="var3923"><lem>reflect</lem></app> on that terrible moment without shuddering <app id="var3924"><lem>and agony.</lem></app> The <app id="var3925"><lem>examination,</lem></app> the
            presence of the magistrate <app id="var3926"><lem>and witnesses,</lem></app> passed like a dream from my <app id="var3927"><lem>memory,</lem></app> when I saw
            the lifeless form of Henry <app id="var3928"><lem>Clerval</lem></app> stretched before <app id="var3929"><lem>me.</lem></app> I gasped for <app id="var3930"><lem>breath; and,</lem></app>
            throwing myself on the <app id="var3931"><lem>body,</lem></app> I <app id="var3932"><lem>exclaimed, “Have</lem></app> my murderous <app id="var3933"><lem>machinations</lem></app> deprived you
            <app id="var3934"><lem>also,</lem></app> my dearest <app id="var3935"><lem>Henry,</lem></app> of <app id="var3936"><lem>life?</lem></app> Two <app id="var3937"><lem>I</lem></app> have already destroyed; other victims await their
            <app id="var3938"><lem>destiny:</lem></app> <app id="var3939"><lem>but</lem></app> you, <app id="var3940"><lem>Clerval,</lem></app> my <app id="var3941"><lem>friend,</lem></app> my <app id="var3942"><lem>benefactor——”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct385a"/>The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried
            out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>
          <p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death: my ravings, as I
            afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine,
            and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of
            the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others, I felt the fingers of the monster
            already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I
            spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter
            cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.</p>
          <p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into
            forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of
            their doating parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the
            bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of
            what materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the
            turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?<anchor id="struct385b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct386a"/> <anchor id="struct386b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3943"><lem>But</lem></app> I was doomed to <app id="var3944"><lem>live; and,</lem></app> in two <app id="var3945"><lem>months,</lem></app> found myself <app id="var3946"><lem>as</lem></app> awaking from a dream, in
            a prison, stretched <pb xml:id="F1831_v_174" n="158"/>on a wretched <app id="var3947"><lem>bed,</lem></app> surrounded by
            <app id="var3948"><lem>gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and</lem></app> all the miserable apparatus of a <app id="var3949"><lem>dungeon.</lem></app> It was <app id="var3950"><lem>morning,</lem></app>
            I <app id="var3951"><lem>remember,</lem></app> when I thus awoke <app id="var3952"><lem>to understanding: I</lem></app> had forgotten <app id="var3953"><lem>the</lem></app> particulars of what
            had <app id="var3954"><lem>happened, and</lem></app> only felt as if some great <app id="var3955"><lem>misfortune</lem></app> had <app id="var3956"><lem>suddenly overwhelmed me; but</lem></app>
            when I looked <app id="var3957"><lem>around,</lem></app> and saw the barred windows, <app id="var3958"><lem>and</lem></app> the squalidness of the room in
            which I was, all flashed across my <app id="var3959"><lem>memory, and</lem></app> I groaned <app id="var3960"><lem>bitterly.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct387a"/>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a
            hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those
            bad qualities which often characterise that class. The lines of her face were hard and
            rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery.
            Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice
            struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings:—</p>
          <p>“Are you better now, sir?” said she.</p>
          <p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all
            true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery
            and horror.”<anchor id="struct387b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct388a"/> <anchor id="struct388b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3961"><lem>“For</lem></app> that matter,” replied the old <app id="var3962"><lem>woman,</lem></app> “if you mean about the gentleman <app id="var3963"><lem>you
            murdered,</lem></app> I believe that it were better for you if you were <app id="var3964"><lem>dead,</lem></app> for I fancy it will go
            hard with <app id="var3965"><lem>you!</lem></app> <app id="var3966"><lem>However, that’s</lem></app> none of my <app id="var3967"><lem>business;</lem></app> I am sent <app id="var3968"><lem>to</lem></app> nurse <app id="var3969"><lem>you, and</lem></app> get you
            <app id="var3970"><lem>well; I</lem></app> do <app id="var3971"><lem>my</lem></app> duty with a safe conscience; it were well if every body did the <app id="var3972"><lem>same.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct389a"/>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person
            just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid, and unable to reflect on all
            that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes
            doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the
            force of reality.</p>
          <p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness
            pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of <pb xml:id="F1831_v_175" n="159"/>love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and
            prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was
            visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage
            of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who
            would gain his fee?<anchor id="struct389b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct390a"/> <anchor id="struct390b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3973"><lem>These</lem></app> were my first <app id="var3974"><lem>reflections;</lem></app> but I soon learned that <app id="var3975"><lem>Mr. Kirwin</lem></app> had <app id="var3976"><lem>shown</lem></app> me
            extreme <app id="var3977"><lem>kindness.</lem></app> He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for <app id="var3978"><lem>me</lem></app>
            (wretched indeed was the <app id="var3979"><lem>best); and</lem></app> it was he who had provided a physician <app id="var3980"><lem>and a nurse.</lem></app>
            It is <app id="var3981"><lem>true,</lem></app> he <app id="var3982"><lem>seldom</lem></app> came to see <app id="var3983"><lem>me; for,</lem></app> although he ardently desired to relieve the
            <app id="var3984"><lem>sufferings</lem></app> of every human <app id="var3985"><lem>creature,</lem></app> he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
            miserable ravings of a <app id="var3986"><lem>murderer.</lem></app> He <app id="var3987"><lem>came, therefore, sometimes,</lem></app> to see that I was not
            <app id="var3988"><lem>neglected;</lem></app> but his visits <app id="var3989"><lem>were short, and with long intervals.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct391a"/> <anchor id="struct391b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3990"><lem>One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open,

            reflected <app id="var3993"><lem>I</lem></app> had better <app id="var3994"><lem>seek</lem></app> death <app id="var3995"><lem>than desire</lem></app> to <app id="var3996"><lem>remain</lem></app> in a world <app id="var3997"><lem>which to me was
            replete</lem></app> with <app id="var3998"><lem>wretchedness.</lem></app> At one time I considered whether I should not <app id="var3999"><lem>declare</lem></app> myself
            <app id="var4000"><lem>guilty, and</lem></app> suffer the penalty of the <app id="var4001"><lem>law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.</lem></app>
            Such were my <app id="var4002"><lem>thoughts,</lem></app> when the door of my <app id="var4003"><lem>apartment was opened,</lem></app> and Mr. Kirwin entered.
            His countenance expressed sympathy and <app id="var4004"><lem>compassion;</lem></app> he drew a chair close to <app id="var4005"><lem>mine, and</lem></app>
            addressed me in <app id="var4006"><lem>French—</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct392a"/>“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do any thing to make you more
            comfortable?”</p>
          <p>“I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole earth there is no
            comfort which I am capable of receiving.”</p>
          <p>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down
            as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy
            abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal
            charge.”</p>
          <p>“That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange <pb xml:id="F1831_v_176" n="160"/>events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am
            and have been, can death be any evil to me?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that
            have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore,
            renowned for its hospitality; seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first
            sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
            unaccountable a manner, and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.”</p>
          <p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of
            my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess
            concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr.
            Kirwin hastened to say—<anchor id="struct392b"/></p>

            death of <app id="var4029"><lem>Clerval,</lem></app> as a new incitement <app id="var4030"><lem>for me to comply with his hellish desires. I put

          <p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my
            exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in rather a severe tone—<anchor id="struct396b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct399a"/>“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to
            pleasure: “is my father indeed come? How kind, how very kind! But where is he, why does
            he not hasten to me?”</p>
          <p>My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my
            former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his
            former benevolence. He rose, and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my

          <p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my

          <p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my

            ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in, and insisted that my strength should not be
            exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of

            Soon, oh!</lem></app> very <app id="var4065"><lem>soon,</lem></app> will death extinguish these <app id="var4066"><lem>throbbings, and relieve</lem></app> me from <app id="var4067"><lem>the</lem></app>

          <p><anchor id="struct403a"/>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison; and
            although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel
            nearly a hundred miles to the county-town, where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged
            himself with every care of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared
            the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the
            court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being
            proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and
            a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.<anchor id="struct403b"/></p>

            penetrated by no <app id="var4092"><lem>light</lem></app> but <app id="var4093"><lem>the glimmer</lem></app> of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they
            were the expressive eyes of <app id="var4094"><lem>Henry,</lem></app> languishing in <app id="var4095"><lem>death,</lem></app> the dark orbs nearly covered by
            the <app id="var4096"><lem>lids, and</lem></app> the long <app id="var4097"><lem>black lashes</lem></app> that fringed <app id="var4098"><lem>them;</lem></app> <app id="var4099"><lem>sometimes</lem></app> it was the <app id="var4100"><lem>watery,</lem></app>

          <p><anchor id="struct405a"/> <anchor id="struct405b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4104"><lem>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of Geneva, which I
            should soon visit—of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from
            me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness; and thought, with melancholy
            delight, of my</lem></app> beloved <app id="var4105"><lem>cousin; or longed, with a devouring <hi rend="italic">maladie du

            in early <app id="var4108"><lem>childhood:</lem></app> but my general <app id="var4109"><lem>state</lem></app> of feeling was <app id="var4110"><lem>a torpor,</lem></app> in which a prison was
            as welcome a <app id="var4111"><lem>residence</lem></app> as the <app id="var4112"><lem>divinest</lem></app> scene in <app id="var4113"><lem>nature; and</lem></app> these fits were seldom
            interrupted but by <app id="var4114"><lem>paroxysms</lem></app> of anguish <app id="var4115"><lem>and despair.</lem></app> At these moments I often
            <app id="var4116"><lem>endeavoured</lem></app> to put an end to the existence I <app id="var4117"><lem>loathed; and</lem></app> it required unceasing
            attendance <app id="var4118"><lem>and</lem></app> vigilance to <app id="var4119"><lem>restrain me</lem></app> from committing some dreadful act of
            violence.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct406a"/>Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my
            selfish despair. It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to
            watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved; and to lie in wait for the murderer,
            that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast
            me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the
            monstrous Image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My
            father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the
            fatigues of a journey: for I was a shattered wreck,—the shadow of a human being. My
            strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton; and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted
            frame.</p>
          <p>Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father
            thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel bound for
            Havre-de-Grace, and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. <pb xml:id="F1831_v_180" n="164"/>It was midnight. I lay on the deck, looking at the
            stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut
            Ireland from my sight; and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I
            should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet
            the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and
            the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision, and
            that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster
            of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while
            residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
            Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the
            creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. I
            was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I
            wept bitterly.<anchor id="struct406b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4120"><lem>Ever</lem></app> since my recovery from the <app id="var4121"><lem>fever,</lem></app> I had been in the custom of taking every night a

            gain the <app id="var4123"><lem>rest necessary</lem></app> for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of

            <app id="var4130"><lem>presented</lem></app> a thousand objects that scared <app id="var4131"><lem>me. Towards morning I was</lem></app> possessed by a kind

            was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the
            present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future, imparted to me a kind of calm
            forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.</lem></app></p>

          <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris.
            I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength, and that I must repose before I could
            continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were indefatigable; but he did not
            know the origin of my sufferings, and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable
            ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not
            abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most
            repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But
            I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among
            them, whose joy it was to shed their blood, and to revel in their groans. How they
            would, each and all, abhor me, and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed
            acts, and the crimes which had their source in me!</p>
          <p>My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society, and strove by various
            arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation
            of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the
            futility of pride.<anchor id="struct408b"/></p>

            appeared to consider it as <app id="var4159"><lem>the offspring of delirium, and that,</lem></app> during my <app id="var4160"><lem>illness,</lem></app> some
            idea of this kind had presented itself to my <app id="var4161"><lem>imagination,</lem></app> the <app id="var4162"><lem>remembrance</lem></app> of which I
            preserved in my <app id="var4163"><lem>convalescence.</lem></app> I avoided <app id="var4164"><lem>explanation, <pb xml:id="F1831_v_182" n="166"/>and maintained</lem></app> a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a
            <app id="var4165"><lem>persuasion</lem></app> that I should be supposed <app id="var4166"><lem>mad;</lem></app> and this <app id="var4167"><lem>in itself would for</lem></app> ever <app id="var4168"><lem>have chained</lem></app>
            my <app id="var4169"><lem>tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill
            my hearer with consternation, and</lem></app> make <app id="var4170"><lem>fear and unnatural horror</lem></app> the <app id="var4171"><lem>inmates of his
            breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy, and</lem></app> was <app id="var4172"><lem>silent when I
            would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet still words like</lem></app> those
            <app id="var4173"><lem>I have recorded,</lem></app> would <app id="var4174"><lem>burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of
            them; but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct411a"/>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “My dearest
            Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an
            assertion again.”</p>
          <p>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
            operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent
            victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood,
            drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
            sacrifice the whole human race.”</p>
          <p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he
            instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and endeavoured to alter the course
            of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes
            that had taken place in Ireland, and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak of
            my misfortunes.<anchor id="struct411b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4272"><lem>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-read her letter,</lem></app> and <app id="var4273"><lem>some softened feelings
            stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the
            apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I
            would die to make her happy. If</lem></app> the monster <app id="var4274"><lem>executed</lem></app> his <app id="var4275"><lem>threat, death was inevitable;

            indeed <app id="var4279"><lem>arrive</lem></app> a few months <app id="var4280"><lem>sooner; but</lem></app> if <app id="var4281"><lem>my torturer should suspect</lem></app> that I <app id="var4282"><lem>postponed

            yet</lem></app> he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the mean <app id="var4286"><lem>time;</lem></app> <app id="var4287"><lem>for,</lem></app> as if
            to <app id="var4288"><lem>show</lem></app> me that he was not yet satiated with <app id="var4289"><lem>blood,</lem></app> he had <app id="var4290"><lem>murdered Clerval</lem></app> immediately
            after the enunciation of <app id="var4291"><lem>his threats.</lem></app> <app id="var4292"><lem>I resolved, therefore,</lem></app> that if <app id="var4293"><lem>my</lem></app> immediate union
            with my cousin <app id="var4294"><lem>would</lem></app> conduce either to hers or my father’s <app id="var4295"><lem>happiness,</lem></app> my <app id="var4296"><lem>adversary’s
            designs</lem></app> against my life should not retard it a single hour.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct421a"/>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I
            fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that
            I may one day enjoy is centred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I
            consecrate my life, and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
            dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far
            from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have
            endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage
            shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But
            until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly
            entreat, and I know you will comply.”</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1831_v_186" n="170"/>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s
            letter, we returned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears
            were in her eyes, as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change
            in her also. She was thinner, and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had
            before charmed me; but her gentleness, and soft looks of compassion, made her a more fit
            companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.<anchor id="struct421b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4297"><lem>The tranquillity</lem></app> <app id="var4298"><lem>which</lem></app> I now enjoyed did not <app id="var4299"><lem>endure. Memory</lem></app> brought madness with <app id="var4300"><lem>it;
            and</lem></app> when I thought of what had <app id="var4301"><lem>passed,</lem></app> a real <app id="var4302"><lem>insanity</lem></app> possessed <app id="var4303"><lem>me;</lem></app> <app id="var4304"><lem>sometimes</lem></app> I was

            <app id="var4309"><lem>at any one, but</lem></app> sat <app id="var4310"><lem>motionless,</lem></app> bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame
            me.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct423a"/>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe
            me when transported by passion, and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
            She wept with me, and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour
            to inspire me with resignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but
            for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
            otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.</p>
          <p>Soon after my arrival, my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth. I
            remained silent.</p>
          <p>“Have you, then, some other attachment?”</p>
          <p>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with delight. Let the
            day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the

            regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to <app id="var4336"><lem>me,</lem></app> if the loss of
            <app id="var4337"><lem>Elizabeth</lem></app> were balanced with <app id="var4338"><lem>it;</lem></app> and I <app id="var4339"><lem>therefore,</lem></app> with <app id="var4340"><lem>a contented and</lem></app> even cheerful
            <app id="var4341"><lem>countenance,</lem></app> agreed with my <app id="var4342"><lem>father,</lem></app> that <app id="var4343"><lem>if</lem></app> my cousin would <app id="var4344"><lem>consent, the ceremony should
            take place</lem></app> in ten <app id="var4345"><lem>days,</lem></app> and thus put, as I <app id="var4346"><lem>imagined,</lem></app> the seal to my fate.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct426a"/>Great God! if for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my
            fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country,
            and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth, than have consented to this miserable
            marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
            intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of
            a far dearer victim.</p>
          <p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic
            feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of
            hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly
            deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union
            with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had
            impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness, might soon dissipate
            into an airy dream, and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.</p>
          <p>Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were received; and all wore
            a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that
            preyed there, and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although
            they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions, a
            part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian
            government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed
            that, immediately after our union, we should proceed <pb xml:id="F1831_v_188" n="172"/>to Villa Lavenza, and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near
            which it stood.<anchor id="struct426b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4347"><lem>In</lem></app> the mean time I took every <app id="var4348"><lem>precaution</lem></app> to defend my <app id="var4349"><lem>person,</lem></app> in case the fiend should
            <app id="var4350"><lem>openly attack me.</lem></app> I carried pistols <app id="var4351"><lem>and</lem></app> a dagger constantly about <app id="var4352"><lem>me,</lem></app> and was ever on
            the watch to prevent <app id="var4353"><lem>artifice; and</lem></app> by these means <app id="var4354"><lem>gained</lem></app> a greater <app id="var4355"><lem>degree</lem></app> of
            <app id="var4356"><lem>tranquillity. Indeed,</lem></app> as the period <app id="var4357"><lem>approached,</lem></app> the <app id="var4358"><lem>threat</lem></app> appeared more as <app id="var4359"><lem>a delusion,</lem></app>
            not to be regarded as worthy to disturb <app id="var4360"><lem>my peace,</lem></app> while the happiness I hoped for in my
            marriage wore <app id="var4361"><lem>a</lem></app> greater appearance of <app id="var4362"><lem>certainty, as the day fixed for</lem></app> its <app id="var4363"><lem>solemnisation</lem></app>
            drew <app id="var4364"><lem>nearer,</lem></app> and I heard it <app id="var4365"><lem>continually spoken</lem></app> of <app id="var4366"><lem>as</lem></app> an <app id="var4367"><lem>occurrence</lem></app> which no <app id="var4368"><lem>accident</lem></app>
            could <app id="var4369"><lem>possibly prevent.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct428a"/>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But
            on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a
            presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret
            which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the mean
            time overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of
            his niece the diffidence of a bride.</p>
          <p>After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my father’s; but it was
            agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at
            Evian, and continuing our voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind
            favourable, all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.<anchor id="struct428b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4370"><lem>Those</lem></app> were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.
            We passed rapidly <app id="var4371"><lem>along:</lem></app> the sun was <app id="var4372"><lem>hot,</lem></app> but we were sheltered <app id="var4373"><lem>from its rays by</lem></app> a kind

            where we saw Mont <app id="var4379"><lem>Salêve,</lem></app> the pleasant banks of <app id="var4380"><lem>Montalègre,</lem></app> and <app id="var4381"><lem>at</lem></app> a <app id="var4382"><lem>distance,

            Jura <app id="var4387"><lem>opposing</lem></app> its dark side to <app id="var4388"><lem>the ambition that would quit its native country, and an
            almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct430a"/><pb xml:id="F1831_v_189" n="173"/>I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful, my
            love. Ah! if you knew what I have suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would
            endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair, that this one day at least
            permits me to enjoy.”<anchor id="struct430b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct432a"/>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon
            melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her
            eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.</p>
          <p>The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and observed its path
            through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come
            closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its
            eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the
            range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.<anchor id="struct432b"/></p>

          <p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short
            time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and

            swept across it swifter than the flight of the <app id="var4430"><lem>vulture,</lem></app> and dimmed her <app id="var4431"><lem>rays,</lem></app> while the
            lake reflected the scene of the busy <app id="var4432"><lem>heavens, rendered</lem></app> still busier by the <app id="var4433"><lem>restless</lem></app>
            waves that were beginning to <app id="var4434"><lem>rise. Suddenly</lem></app> a heavy storm of rain descended.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct436a"/>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a
            thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped
            a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I
            would sell my life dearly, and not shrink from the conflict until my own life, or that
            of my adversary, was extinguished.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence; but there
            was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling she asked,
            “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?”</p>
          <p>“Oh! peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and all will be safe: but this
            night is dreadful, very dreadful.”</p>
          <p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the
            combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her
            to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the
            situation of my enemy.<anchor id="struct436b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4435"><lem>She</lem></app> left <app id="var4436"><lem>me,</lem></app> and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the <app id="var4437"><lem>house,

          <p><anchor id="struct438a"/>Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the

            covered by her hair. Every where I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and
            relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live?
            Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only

            She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld <app id="var4474"><lem>her; and now,</lem></app> as she

            <app id="var4488"><lem>fiend’s grasp</lem></app> was on her <app id="var4489"><lem>neck, and</lem></app> the breath had ceased to issue from her <app id="var4490"><lem>lips.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct440a"/> <anchor id="struct440b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4491"><lem>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows

            kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The</lem></app>
            shutters had been thrown <app id="var4492"><lem>back; and,</lem></app> with a sensation of horror not to be <app id="var4493"><lem>described,</lem></app> I
            saw at the open window a figure the most hideous <app id="var4494"><lem>and abhorred.</lem></app> A grin was on the face of
            the <app id="var4495"><lem>monster;</lem></app> he seemed to <app id="var4496"><lem>jeer,</lem></app> as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the
            corpse of my <app id="var4497"><lem>wife. I</lem></app> rushed towards the <app id="var4498"><lem>window,</lem></app> and drawing a pistol from my <app id="var4499"><lem>bosom,
            fired;</lem></app> but he eluded <app id="var4500"><lem>me, leaped</lem></app> from his <app id="var4501"><lem>station, and,</lem></app> running with <app id="var4502"><lem>the</lem></app> swiftness of

          <p><anchor id="struct441a"/>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he
            had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.
            After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to
            have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search
            the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.</p>
          <p>I attempted to accompany them, and proceeded a short distance from the house; but my
            head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state
            of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of
            fever. In this state I was carried back, and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what
            had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something that I had
            lost.</p>
          <p>After an interval, I arose, and, as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the
            corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around—I hung over it, and joined my
            sad tears to theirs—all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind; but my
            thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes, and their
            cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the
            execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment
            I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my
            father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet.
            This idea made me shudder, and re<pb xml:id="F1831_v_193" n="177"/>called me to action.
            I started up, and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.<anchor id="struct441b"/></p>

            incapable of any <app id="var4523"><lem>exertion. I</lem></app> threw down the <app id="var4524"><lem>oar; and</lem></app> leaning my head upon my <app id="var4525"><lem>hands,</lem></app> gave
            way to every gloomy idea that <app id="var4526"><lem>arose. If</lem></app> I looked <app id="var4527"><lem>up,</lem></app> I saw the scenes which were
            familiar to me in my happier <app id="var4528"><lem>time,</lem></app> and which I had contemplated but the day <app id="var4529"><lem>before</lem></app> in
            the <app id="var4530"><lem>company</lem></app> of her who was <app id="var4531"><lem>now</lem></app> but a shadow <app id="var4532"><lem>and</lem></app> a <app id="var4533"><lem>recollection.</lem></app> <app id="var4534"><lem>Tears</lem></app> streamed from my

            had done <app id="var4540"><lem>a</lem></app> few hours <app id="var4541"><lem>before;</lem></app> they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so

            miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct443a"/>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event?
            Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their <hi rend="italic">acme</hi>, and
            what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were
            snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a

            only</lem></app> objects that pressed upon <app id="var4574"><lem>me. Sometimes, indeed,</lem></app> I <app id="var4575"><lem>dreamt</lem></app> that I wandered in

            myself in a dungeon. Melancholy <app id="var4580"><lem>followed,</lem></app> but by degrees I <app id="var4581"><lem>gained</lem></app> a clear conception of
            my miseries <app id="var4582"><lem>and situation, and</lem></app> was then released from my prison. For they had called me
            <app id="var4583"><lem>mad; and during</lem></app> many <app id="var4584"><lem>months,</lem></app> as I <app id="var4585"><lem>understood,</lem></app> a solitary cell had been my
            habitation.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct446a"/>Liberty, however, had been an useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason,
            at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me,
            I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon
            whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening
            rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within
            my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.</p>
          <p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best
            means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired
            to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I
            knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority
            for the apprehension of the murderer.</p>
          <p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness:—“Be assured, sir,” said he,
            “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.”<anchor id="struct446b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct447a"/> <anchor id="struct447b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4586"><lem>“I</lem></app> thank you,” <app id="var4587"><lem>replied I; “listen, therefore,</lem></app> to <app id="var4588"><lem>the</lem></app> deposition <app id="var4589"><lem>that I</lem></app> have to <app id="var4590"><lem>make.</lem></app> It

            connected to be <app id="var4598"><lem>mis<pb xml:id="F1831_v_195" n="179"/>taken</lem></app> for a <app id="var4599"><lem>dream, and</lem></app> I have no

            had formed in my own heart <app id="var4603"><lem>a</lem></app> resolution to pursue my destroyer to <app id="var4604"><lem>death; and</lem></app> this
            purpose quieted my <app id="var4605"><lem>agony, and for an interval</lem></app> reconciled me to life. I now related my
            <app id="var4606"><lem>history, briefly,</lem></app> but with firmness <app id="var4607"><lem>and precision,</lem></app> marking <app id="var4608"><lem>the dates</lem></app> with <app id="var4609"><lem>accuracy,</lem></app> and
            never deviating into invective or <app id="var4610"><lem>exclamation.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct448a"/>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became
            more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a
            lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.</p>
          <p>When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I accuse, and for
            whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty
            as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from
            the execution of those functions on this occasion.”<anchor id="struct448b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct449a"/> <anchor id="struct449b"/></p>
          <p>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. He had
            heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and
            supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the
            whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly
            afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have
            powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can
            traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to
            intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no
            one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region he may now
            inhabit.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct450a"/>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed
            taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of
            prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to
            pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1831_v_196" n="180"/>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate
            was intimidated:—“You are mistaken,” said he, “I will exert myself; if it is in my power
            to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his
            crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that
            this will prove impracticable, and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you
            should make up your mind to disappointment.”<anchor id="struct450b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4611"><lem>“That cannot be;</lem></app> <app id="var4612"><lem>but all</lem></app> that <app id="var4613"><lem>I</lem></app> can say <app id="var4614"><lem>will</lem></app> be of little <app id="var4615"><lem>avail. My revenge</lem></app> is of no
            moment to <app id="var4616"><lem>you; yet,</lem></app> while I allow it to <app id="var4617"><lem>be</lem></app> a <app id="var4618"><lem>vice,</lem></app> I confess that it is the devouring
            <app id="var4619"><lem>and</lem></app> only passion of my <app id="var4620"><lem>soul. My</lem></app> rage is <app id="var4621"><lem>unspeakable,</lem></app> when I reflect that the <app id="var4622"><lem>murderer,</lem></app>
            whom I have turned loose upon <app id="var4623"><lem>society,</lem></app> still <app id="var4624"><lem>exists.</lem></app> <app id="var4625"><lem>You</lem></app> refuse my just <app id="var4626"><lem>demand:</lem></app> I have

            <app id="var4630"><lem>destruction.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct452a"/>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner,
            and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said
            to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other
            ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance
            of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale
            as the effects of delirium.</p>
          <p>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what
            it is you say.”</p>
          <p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on some other mode
            of action.</p><comment text="ebb: centered underscore a few lines below"/>

          <p>M<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> present situation was one in which all voluntary thought
            was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with
            strength and composure; it moulded my feelings, and allowed me to be calculating <pb xml:id="F1831_v_197" n="181"/>and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death
            would have been my portion.</p>
          <p>My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy
            and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself
            with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and
            departed.</p>
          <p>And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast
            portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which travellers, in deserts
            and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times
            have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But
            revenge kept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.<anchor id="struct452b"/></p>

            monster drink deep of <app id="var4699"><lem>agony;</lem></app> <app id="var4700"><lem>let</lem></app> him feel the despair that now torments me.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct455a"/>I had begun my abjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost assured me that the
            shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion; but the furies possessed
            me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.</p>
          <p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rung on
            my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell
            surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been
            possessed by frenzy, and have destroyed my miserable existence, but that my vow was
            heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away; when a well-known
            and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—“I am
            satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”</p>
          <p>I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but the devil eluded my
            grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and shone full upon his ghastly and
            distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal speed.<anchor id="struct455b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct456a"/> <anchor id="struct456b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4701"><lem>I pursued</lem></app> <app id="var4702"><lem>him; and</lem></app> for many months this has been my task. <app id="var4703"><lem>Guided</lem></app> by a slight <app id="var4704"><lem>clue,</lem></app> I
            <app id="var4705"><lem>followed</lem></app> the windings of the <app id="var4706"><lem>Rhone,</lem></app> but <app id="var4707"><lem>vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared; and,</lem></app> by
            a strange <app id="var4708"><lem>chance,</lem></app> I saw the fiend enter by <app id="var4709"><lem>night, and</lem></app> hide himself in a vessel bound for
            the <app id="var4710"><lem>Black Sea. I took my passage in</lem></app> the <app id="var4711"><lem>same ship; but he escaped, I know not</lem></app> <app id="var4712"><lem>how.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct457a"/>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever
            followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition,
            informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of
            him, I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my <pb xml:id="F1831_v_199" n="183"/>head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white
            plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can
            you understand what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the least
            pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with
            me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps; and, when
            I most murmured, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.
            Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a repast was
            prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed,
            coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate; but I will not doubt that it was set
            there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens
            cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few
            drops that revived me, and vanish.<anchor id="struct457b"/></p>

            <app id="var4718"><lem>places</lem></app> human beings were seldom <app id="var4719"><lem>seen; and</lem></app> I generally subsisted <app id="var4720"><lem>on</lem></app> the wild <app id="var4721"><lem>animals</lem></app> that
            crossed my <app id="var4722"><lem>path.</lem></app> I had money with <app id="var4723"><lem>me, and</lem></app> gained the friendship of the villagers by

          <p><app id="var4733"><lem>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone
            that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when most miserable, I sank to repose,
            and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these
            moments, or rather hours, of happiness, that I might retain strength to fulfil my
            pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite,</lem></app> I should have sunk under my <app id="var4734"><lem>hardships. During</lem></app> the
            day I was <app id="var4735"><lem>sustained and inspirited</lem></app> by the hope of <app id="var4736"><lem>night:</lem></app> <app id="var4737"><lem>for</lem></app> in sleep I saw my <app id="var4738"><lem>friends,</lem></app>

            for <app id="var4754"><lem>them! how</lem></app> did I cling to their dear <app id="var4755"><lem>forms,</lem></app> as sometimes they <app id="var4756"><lem>haunted</lem></app> even my <app id="var4757"><lem>waking

            more as a task enjoined by heaven, <app id="var4763"><lem>as the mechanical impulse</lem></app> <app id="var4764"><lem>of some power</lem></app> of <app id="var4765"><lem>which I
            was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct460a"/>What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks
            in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone, that guided me, and instigated my
            fury. “My reign is not yet over,” (these words were legible in one of these
            inscriptions;) “you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting
            ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am
            impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare;
            eat, and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives; but many
            hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”</p>
          <p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to
            torture and death. Never will I give up my search, until he or I perish; and then with
            what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth, and my departed friends, who even now prepare
            for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!<anchor id="struct460b"/></p>

            <app id="var4771"><lem>increased</lem></app> in <app id="var4772"><lem>a</lem></app> degree almost too severe to support. The <app id="var4773"><lem>peasants</lem></app> were shut up in their
            <app id="var4774"><lem>hovels,</lem></app> and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom
            starvation had forced <app id="var4775"><lem>from their hiding-places</lem></app> to seek for prey. The rivers were covered
            with <app id="var4776"><lem>ice,</lem></app> and no fish could be <app id="var4777"><lem>procured; and thus I</lem></app> was <app id="var4778"><lem>cut off</lem></app> <app id="var4779"><lem>from my chief article of
            maintenance.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct462a"/>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription
            that he left was in these <pb xml:id="F1831_v_201" n="185"/>words:—“Prepare! your toils
            only begin: wrap yourself in furs, and provide food; for we shall soon enter upon a
            journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.”</p>
          <p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to
            fail in my purpose; and, calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated
            fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance, and formed
            the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how unlike it was to the blue seas of the south!
            Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and
            ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of
            Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt
            down, and, with a full heart, thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to
            the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with
            him.<anchor id="struct462b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct465a"/>I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean;

          <p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have endured misery, which
            nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could
            have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my
            passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my
            destruction. But again the frost came, and made the paths of the sea secure.<anchor id="struct465b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct466a"/> <anchor id="struct466b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4844"><lem>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed
            three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon

            indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once,
            after</lem></app> the poor animals that <app id="var4845"><lem>conveyed</lem></app> me <app id="var4846"><lem>had</lem></app> with incredible toil gained the summit of <app id="var4847"><lem>a

            drops, until,</lem></app> giving way to the emotions that oppressed <app id="var4868"><lem>me,</lem></app> I wept aloud.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct467a"/>But this was not the time for delay: I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion,
            gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely
            necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge
            was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a
            short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly
            gained on it; and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more
            than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.</p>
          <p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly
            extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A
            ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled
            beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain.
            The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it
            split, and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished:
            in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left
            drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was continually lessening, and thus preparing
            for me a hideous death.<anchor id="struct467b"/></p>

          the simplest truth; yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed
          me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater
          conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and

          surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars
          of his creature’s formation: but on this point he was impenetrable.</p>
        <p>“Are you mad, my friend?” said he; “or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?
          Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! learn
          my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own.”</p>
        <p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them,
          and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but principally in giving
          the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved
          my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to

          those talents that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I
          had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could
          not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this thought, which supported me
          in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my

        <p>My beloved Sister,</p>
        <p>I write to you, encompassed by peril, and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again
          dear England, and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice,
          which admit of no escape, and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows,
          whom I have persuaded to be my companions, look towards me for aid; but I have none to
          bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes
          do not desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect <pb xml:id="F1831_v_208" n="192"/>that the
          lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the
          cause.</p>
        <p>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction,
          and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of
          despair, and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening failing of your
          heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you
          have a husband, and lovely children; you may be happy: Heaven bless you, and make you

        <p><anchor id="struct482a"/>September 5th.</p>
        <p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly probable
          that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.</p>
        <p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in
          their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already
          found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health:
          a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused
          to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.<anchor id="struct482b"/></p>

        <p><app id="var5109"><lem>I</lem></app> mentioned <app id="var5110"><lem>in my</lem></app> last letter the fears I <app id="var5111"><lem>entertained</lem></app> of <app id="var5112"><lem>a mutiny.</lem></app> This <app id="var5113"><lem>morning,</lem></app> as I sat
          watching the wan countenance of my <app id="var5114"><lem>friend—his</lem></app> eyes half <app id="var5115"><lem>closed,</lem></app> and his limbs hanging
          <app id="var5116"><lem>listlessly,—I</lem></app> was <app id="var5117"><lem>roused</lem></app> by half a dozen of the <app id="var5118"><lem>sailors,</lem></app> who <app id="var5119"><lem>demanded</lem></app> admission into the
          <app id="var5120"><lem>cabin. They <pb xml:id="F1831_v_209" n="193"/>entered, and</lem></app> their leader <app id="var5121"><lem>addressed</lem></app> me. He
          told me that he <app id="var5122"><lem>and</lem></app> his <app id="var5123"><lem>companions</lem></app> had been chosen by the other sailors to come in
          deputation to <app id="var5124"><lem>me,</lem></app> to make <app id="var5125"><lem>me a requisition, which,</lem></app> in <app id="var5126"><lem>justice,</lem></app> I could not refuse. We were
          immured <app id="var5127"><lem>in ice, and should</lem></app> probably never <app id="var5128"><lem>escape;</lem></app> but they feared that if, as was
          <app id="var5129"><lem>possible,</lem></app> the ice should <app id="var5130"><lem>dissipate,</lem></app> and a free passage <app id="var5131"><lem>be opened,</lem></app> I should be rash enough
          to <app id="var5132"><lem>continue</lem></app> my <app id="var5133"><lem>voyage, and</lem></app> lead them <app id="var5134"><lem>into</lem></app> fresh <app id="var5135"><lem>dangers,</lem></app> after they <app id="var5136"><lem>might happily</lem></app> have
          <app id="var5137"><lem>surmounted</lem></app> this. They <app id="var5138"><lem>insisted, therefore,</lem></app> that I should <app id="var5139"><lem>engage with</lem></app> a solemn <app id="var5140"><lem>promise,</lem></app>
          that <app id="var5141"><lem>if</lem></app> the vessel should be <app id="var5142"><lem>freed I would instantly direct my course southward.</lem></app></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct484a"/>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired; nor had I yet conceived the idea of
          returning, if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this
          demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent,
          and, indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes
          sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he
          said—<anchor id="struct484b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct485a"/> <anchor id="struct485b"/></p>
        <p><app id="var5143"><lem>“What</lem></app> do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so easily turned from

          Not because the way was smooth <app id="var5147"><lem>and</lem></app> placid as a <app id="var5148"><lem>southern sea,</lem></app> but because it was full of
          dangers <app id="var5149"><lem>and terror;</lem></app> <app id="var5150"><lem>because,</lem></app> at every new <app id="var5151"><lem>incident,</lem></app> your fortitude was to be called <app id="var5152"><lem>forth,
          and</lem></app> your courage <app id="var5153"><lem>exhibited; because</lem></app> danger <app id="var5154"><lem>and death surrounded it, and</lem></app> these you were to

          You were <app id="var5158"><lem>hereafter to</lem></app> be <app id="var5159"><lem>hailed</lem></app> as the benefactors of your <app id="var5160"><lem>species;</lem></app> <app id="var5161"><lem>your name adored,</lem></app> as

          <app id="var5165"><lem>now, behold,</lem></app> with the first <app id="var5166"><lem>imagination</lem></app> of <app id="var5167"><lem>danger, or,</lem></app> if you <app id="var5168"><lem>will,</lem></app> <app id="var5169"><lem>the</lem></app> first mighty <app id="var5170"><lem>and</lem></app>

          who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were
          chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye
          need not have come thus far, and dragged your captain to the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_210" n="194"/>shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! be men, or be more
          than men. Be steady to your purposes, and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such
          stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable, and cannot withstand you, if you say that it
          shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your
          brows. Return, as heroes who have fought and conquered, and who know not what it is to
          turn their backs on the foe.”</lem></app></p>

          men were <app id="var5182"><lem>moved?</lem></app> They looked at one <app id="var5183"><lem>another, and</lem></app> were unable to reply. I <app id="var5184"><lem>spoke;</lem></app> I told them

        <p><anchor id="struct487a"/>They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in languor, and almost
          deprived of life.</p>
        <p>How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather die than return shamefully,—my
          purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of
          glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.</p>
        <p>September 7th.</p>
        <p>The die is cast; I have consented to return, if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes
          blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed. It requires
          more philosophy than I possess, to bear this injustice with patience.</p>
        <p>September 12th.</p>
        <p>It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory;—I have
          lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear
          sister; and, while I am wafted towards England, and towards you, I will not despond.<anchor id="struct487b"/></p>

        <p><app id="var5193"><lem>September 9th, the</lem></app> ice began to <app id="var5194"><lem>move,</lem></app> and roarings like thunder <app id="var5195"><lem>were</lem></app> heard at a <app id="var5196"><lem>distance,</lem></app>
          as the <app id="var5197"><lem>islands</lem></app> split <app id="var5198"><lem>and</lem></app> cracked in every direction. We were in the most <app id="var5199"><lem>imminent peril;</lem></app>
          <app id="var5200"><lem>but,</lem></app> as we could only remain <app id="var5201"><lem>passive,</lem></app> my chief <app id="var5202"><lem>atten<pb xml:id="F1831_v_211" n="195"/>tion</lem></app>
          was <app id="var5203"><lem>occupied</lem></app> by my <app id="var5204"><lem>unfortunate guest,</lem></app> whose illness <app id="var5205"><lem>increased in</lem></app> such a <app id="var5206"><lem>degree,</lem></app> that <app id="var5207"><lem>he</lem></app>
          was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked <app id="var5208"><lem>behind us,</lem></app> and was driven with force
          towards the <app id="var5209"><lem>north; a breeze</lem></app> sprung from <app id="var5210"><lem>the west,</lem></app> <app id="var5211"><lem>and</lem></app> on the 11th the passage <app id="var5212"><lem>towards</lem></app> the

        <p><anchor id="struct492a"/>It was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was entirely extinct.
          At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty, and was unable to speak. The

          time he told me, that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.<anchor id="struct492b"/></p>

        <p>“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed: “in his murder my crimes are consummated; the
