    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p13"/>In this description of our domestic circle I include Henry Clerval; for he was
    constantly with us. He went to school with me, and generally passed the afternoon at our
    house: for being an only child, and destitute of companions at home, his father was well
    pleased that he should find associates at our house; and we were never completely happy
    when Clerval was absent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p13"/>
