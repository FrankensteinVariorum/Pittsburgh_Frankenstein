    distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
    syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
    He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity and indefatigable attention to
    public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his
    country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until
    the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
    relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing
    state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was
    Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
    poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
    his rank and magni<pb xml:id="F1831_v_035" n="19"/>ficence. Having paid his debts,
    therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of
    Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the
    truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
    circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so
    little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek
    him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
    assistance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before
    my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,
    which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and
    despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the
    wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some
    months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
    merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only
    became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took
    so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness,
    incapable of any exertion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that
    their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
    support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
    rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by
    various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely
    occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month
    her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame
    her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
    chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_036" n="20"/>poor
    girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend, he
    conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years
    after this event Caroline became his wife.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/>
