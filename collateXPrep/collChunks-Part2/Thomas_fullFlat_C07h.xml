    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p23"/>The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I eagerly inquired of
    my father the nature and origin of thunder and lightning. He replied, “Electricity;”
    describing at the same time the various effects of that power. He constructed a small
    electrical machine, and exhibited a few experiments; he made also a kite, with a wire
    and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds.<note sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p23_note1"/>you said your family was not sientific.<note eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p23_note1"/>
    <p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p23"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p24"/>This last stroke completed the overthrow <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_070" n="058"/>of
    Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, who had so long reigned the lords of
    my imagination. But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to commence the study of
    any modern system; and this disinclination was influenced by the following
    circumstance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p24"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p25"/>My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures upon natural
    philosophy, to which I cheerfully consented. Some accident prevented my attending these
    lectures until the course was nearly finished. The lecture, being therefore one of the
    last, was entirely incomprehensible to me. The professor discoursed with the greatest
    fluency of potassium and boron, of sulphates and oxyds, terms to which I could affix no
    idea; and I became disgusted with the science of natural philosophy, although I still
    read <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_071" n="059"/>Pliny and Buffon with delight, authors, in my
    estimation, of nearly equal interest and utility.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p25"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p26"/>My occupations at this age were principally the mathematics, and most of the branches
    of study appertaining to that science. I was busily employed in learning languages;
    Latin was already familiar to me, and I began to read some of the easiest Greek authors
    without the help of a lexicon. I also perfectly understood English and German. This is
    the list of my accomplishments at the age of seventeen; and you may conceive that my
    hours were fully employed in acquiring and maintaining a knowledge of this various
    literature.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p26"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p27"/>Another task also devolved upon me, when I became the instructor of my brothers. Ernest
    was six years younger than myself, and was my principal pu<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_072" n="060"/>pil. He had been afflicted with ill health from his infancy, through which
    Elizabeth and I had been his constant nurses: his disposition was gentle, but he was
    incapable of any severe application. William, the youngest of our family, was yet an
    infant, and the most beautiful little fellow in the world; his lively blue eyes, dimpled
    cheeks, and endearing manners, inspired the tenderest affection.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p27"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p28"/>Such was our domestic circle, from which care and pain seemed for ever banished. My
    father directed our studies, and my mother partook of our enjoyments. Neither of us
    possessed the slightest pre-eminence over the other; the voice of command was never
    heard amongst us; but mutual affection engaged us all to comply with and obey the
    slightest desire of each other.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p28"/>
