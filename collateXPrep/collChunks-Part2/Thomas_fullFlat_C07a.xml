      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1"/> I <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1_hi1"/>AM<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1_hi1"/> by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most
            distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
            syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
            He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to
            public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_052" n="040"/>his country; and it was not until the decline of
            life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on the state sons who might carry his
            virtues and his name down to posterity.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p1"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
            relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing
            state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was
            Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
            poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
            his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable
            manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown
            and in wretchedness. My father loved Beau<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_053" n="041"/>fort with
            the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
            circumstances. He grieved also for the loss of his society, and resolved to seek him out
            and endeavour to persuade him to begin the world again through his credit and
            assistance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p2"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before
            my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,
            which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and
            despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the
            wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some
            months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a mer<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_054" n="042"/>chant’s house. The interval was consequently spent
            in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for
            reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three
            months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p3"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that
            their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
            support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
            rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by
            various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p4"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_055" n="043"/>was more entirely occupied in attending him; her
            means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms,
            leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt by
            Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a
            protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and after the
            interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection
            of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter1_div4_div1_p5"/>
