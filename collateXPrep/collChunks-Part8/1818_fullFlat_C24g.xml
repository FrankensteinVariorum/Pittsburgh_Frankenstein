    native town.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div19_p10"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div19_p11"/>I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced to comply; for a
    more indulgent and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_013" n="009"/>less dictatorial parent did not
    exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to Strasburgh, where
    Clerval would join me. Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland, and our
    principal stay would be in England. We should return by France; and it was agreed that
    the tour should occupy the space of two years.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div19_p11"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div19_p12"/>My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with Elizabeth should take
    place immediately on my return to Geneva. “These two years,” said he, “will pass
    swiftly, and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness. And,
    indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive, when we shall all be united, and
    neither hopes or fears arise to disturb our domestic calm.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div19_p12"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div19_p13"/>“I am content,” I replied, “with <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_014" n="010"/>your
    arrangement. By that time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we
    at present are.” I sighed; but my father kindly forbore to question me further
    concerning the cause of my dejection. He hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of
    travelling, would restore my tranquillity.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div19_p13"/>
