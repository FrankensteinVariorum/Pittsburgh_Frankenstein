    with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the
    existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be
    by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; and would he not
    accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch
    as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with the idea of the pos<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_372" n="99"/>sibility that the reverse of this might happen. But
    through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature, I allowed myself
    to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly
    intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter17_div4_div18_p14"/>
