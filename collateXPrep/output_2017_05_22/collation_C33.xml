I am surrounded by mountains of ice, which admit of no escape, and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave <app><rdg wit="#f1818">fellows </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">fellows, </rdg></app>whom I have persuaded to be my <app><rdg wit="#f1818">companions </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">companions, </rdg></app>look towards me for aid; but I have none to bestow.

If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And </rdg></app>what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair, and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening <app><rdg wit="#f1818">failings </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">failing </rdg></app>of your heart-felt expectations <app><rdg wit="#f1818">are, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">is, </rdg></app>in prospect, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">more </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">more, </rdg></app>terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband, and lovely children; you may be happy: <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">Heaven </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">heaven </rdg></app>bless you, and make you so! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeavours to fill me with hope; and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">who </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">wbo </rdg></app>have attempted this sea, and, in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence: when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and, while they hear his voice, they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills, which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each <app><rdg wit="#f1818">day’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">day of </rdg></app>expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; September 5th. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health: a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed, and his limbs hanging listlessly,—I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who <app><rdg wit="#f1818">desired </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">demanded </rdg></app>admission into the cabin. They <app><rdg wit="#f1818">entered; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">entered, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;pb n="193" xml:id="F1831_v_209"/&gt;entered, </rdg></app>and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me, to make me a <app><rdg wit="#f1818">demand, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">requisition, </rdg></app>which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice, and should probably never escape; but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate, and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage, and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They <app><rdg wit="#f1818">desired, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">insisted, </rdg></app>therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise, that if the vessel should be <app><rdg wit="#f1818">freed, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">freed </rdg></app>I would instantly direct my course southward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This speech troubled me. I had not despaired; nor had I yet <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">conceived </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">conceited </rdg></app>the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, <app><rdg wit="#f1818">and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and, </rdg></app>indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said— &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">And </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">and </rdg></app>wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror; because, at every new incident, your fortitude was to be called forth, and your courage exhibited; because danger and death <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">surrounded, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">surrounded it, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">and these dangers </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and these </rdg></app>you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species; your <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">name </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">names </rdg></app>adored, as belonging to brave men who encountered death for <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">honour </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">honour, </rdg></app>and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away, and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far, and dragged your captain to the &lt;pb n="194" xml:id="F1831_v_210"/&gt;shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes, and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts <app><rdg wit="#f1818">might </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">may </rdg></app>be; it is mutable, <app><rdg wit="#f1831">and </rdg></app>cannot withstand you, if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Return </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Return, </rdg></app>as heroes who have fought and conquered, and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">moved. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">moved? </rdg></app>They looked at one another, and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire, and consider of what had been said: that I would not lead them <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">further </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">farther </rdg></app>north, if they strenuously desired the contrary; but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They retired, and I turned towards my friend; but he was sunk in languor, and almost deprived of life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How all this will terminate, I know not; but I had rather <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">die, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">die </rdg></app>than return shamefully,—my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">hardships. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">haidships. </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;September 7th.&lt;/hi&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; September 7th. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The die is cast; I have consented to return, if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess, to bear this injustice with patience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">&lt;pb n="v3_172" xml:id="F1818_v3_176"/&gt;&lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;September 12th.&lt;/hi&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">&lt;pb n="260" xml:id="F1823_v2_533"/&gt;September </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">September </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1823">12th </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">12th. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory;—I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and, while I am wafted towards England, and towards you, I will not despond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; September <app><rdg wit="#f1818">19th, &lt;comment&gt; &lt;note&gt; PDF displays 19 but correct date should be SEPTEMBER 9 &lt;/note&gt; &lt;/comment&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">9th, </rdg></app>the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance, as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the most imminent peril; but, as we could only remain passive, my chief atten&lt;pb n="195" xml:id="F1831_v_211"/&gt;tion was occupied by my unfortunate guest, whose illness increased in such a degree, that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us, and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprung from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this, and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke, and asked the cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they will soon return to England.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Do you then really return?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Alas! <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">yes; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">yes ; </rdg></app>I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">purpose, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">purpose; </rdg></app>but mine is assigned to me by <app><rdg wit="#f1818">heaven, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Heaven, </rdg></app>and I dare not. I am weak; but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back, and fainted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was long before he was restored; and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his <app><rdg wit="#f1818">eyes, but </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">eyes; </rdg></app>he breathed with difficulty, and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught, and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the mean time he told me, that my friend had <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">certainly </rdg></app>not many hours to live. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; His sentence was <app><rdg wit="#f1818">pronounced, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">pronounced; </rdg></app>and I could only grieve, and be patient. I sat by his <app><rdg wit="#f1818">bed </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">bed, </rdg></app>watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and, bidding me come near, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">said—“Alas! </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">said— “Alas! </rdg></app>the strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred, and ardent desire of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">revenge </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">revenge, </rdg></app>I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">blameable. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">blamable. </rdg></app>In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature, and was bound to&lt;pb n="196" xml:id="F1831_v_212"/&gt;wards him, to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty; but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards <app><rdg wit="#f1818">my fellow-creatures </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">the beings of my own species </rdg></app>had greater claims to my attention, because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness, in evil: he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself, that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work; and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends, to <app><rdg wit="#f1818">fulfill </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">fulfil </rdg></app>this task; and now, that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">well balancing </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">well-balancing </rdg></app>of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">respects </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">respects, </rdg></app>this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity, and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; His voice became fainter as he spoke; and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sunk into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak, but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for &lt;pb n="197" xml:id="F1831_v_213"/&gt;ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I <app><rdg wit="#f1818">say </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">say, </rdg></app>that will enable you to understand the depth of my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">sorrow? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">sorrow ? </rdg></app>All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must <app><rdg wit="#f1818">arise </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">arise, </rdg></app>and examine. Good night, my sister. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I entered the cabin, where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe; gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror, and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome, yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He paused, looking on me with wonder; and, again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">uncontrollable </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">uncontrolable </rdg></app>passion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “That is also my victim!” he <app><rdg wit="#f1818">exclaimed; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">exclaimed: </rdg></app>“in his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! &lt;pb n="198" xml:id="F1831_v_214"/&gt;generous and self-devoted being! what does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou <app><rdg wit="#f1818">lovest. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">lovedst. </rdg></app>Alas! he is <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">cold, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">cold; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">he may not </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">he cannot </rdg></app>answer me.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; His voice seemed suffocated; and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend, in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my <app><rdg wit="#f1818">looks upon </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">eyes to </rdg></app>his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address <app><rdg wit="#f1818">him, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">him </rdg></app>in a pause of the tempest of his passion: “Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of conscience, and heeded the stings of remorse, before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “And do you <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">dream?” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">dream ?” </rdg></app>said the dæmon; “do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?—He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse, “he suffered not <app><rdg wit="#f1818">more </rdg></app>in the consummation of the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">deed;—oh! </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">deed—oh! </rdg></app>not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">ye </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">you </rdg></app>that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy; and, when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">change </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">change, </rdg></app>without torture such as you cannot even imagine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “After the murder of Clerval, I returned to <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Switzerland heartbroken </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Switzerland, heart-broken </rdg></app>and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror: I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness; that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon <app><rdg wit="#f1818">me </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">me, </rdg></app>he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an in&lt;pb n="199" xml:id="F1831_v_215"/&gt;satiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat, and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture; but I was the slave, not the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">master </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">master, </rdg></app>of an impulse, which I detested, yet could not disobey. Yet when she died!—nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all <app><rdg wit="#f1818">anguish </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">anguish, </rdg></app>to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was <app><rdg wit="#f1818">re-kindled </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">rekindled </rdg></app>within me. “Wretch!” I said, “it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and, </rdg></app>when they are <app><rdg wit="#f1818">consumed </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">consumed, </rdg></app>you sit among the ruins, and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! if he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">prey </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">prey, </rdg></app>of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">feel; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">feel, </rdg></app>you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being; “yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone, while my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings, who, pardoning my &lt;pb n="200" xml:id="F1831_v_216"/&gt;outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">bringing forth. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">unfolding. </rdg></app>I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">vice </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">crime </rdg></app>has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">crime, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">guilt, </rdg></app>no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I <app><rdg wit="#f1818">call </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">run </rdg></app>over the frightful catalogue of my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">deeds, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sins, </rdg></app>I cannot believe that I am <app><rdg wit="#f1818">he </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">the same creature </rdg></app>whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">desolation; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">desolation ; </rdg></app>I am <app><rdg wit="#f1818">quite </rdg></app>alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But, in the detail which he gave you of them, he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured, wasting in impotent passions. For <app><rdg wit="#f1818">whilst </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">while </rdg></app>I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me; but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived, and long for &lt;pb n="201" xml:id="F1831_v_217"/&gt;the moment when <app><rdg wit="#f1818">they </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">these hands </rdg></app>will meet my eyes, when <app><rdg wit="#f1818">it </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">that imagination </rdg></app>will haunt my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">thoughts, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">thoughts </rdg></app>no more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither <app><rdg wit="#f1818">your’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">yours </rdg></app>nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being, and accomplish that which must be done; but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft which brought me <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">hither, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">thither, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">and I </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and </rdg></app>shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile, and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars, or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">sense, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sense </rdg></app>will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">first </rdg></app>images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">chirping </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">warbling </rdg></app>of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes, and torn <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">by </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">bv </rdg></app>the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of human kind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive, and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou <app><rdg wit="#f1818">hast not yet </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">hadst not </rdg></app>ceased to think and feel, thou <app><rdg wit="#f1818">desirest not my life for my own misery. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. </rdg></app>Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine; for the bitter sting of remorse <app><rdg wit="#f1818">may </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">will </rdg></app>not cease to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">rankle </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">rankle, </rdg></app>in my wounds until death shall close them for ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;pb n="202" xml:id="F1831_v_218"/&gt;“But soon,” he cried, with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my <app><rdg wit="#f1818">funeral&lt;pb n="v3_192" xml:id="F1818_v3_196"/&gt;pile </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">funeral pile </rdg></app>triumphantly, and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace; or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and distance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;head&gt; THE END. <app><rdg wit="#f1818">&lt;/head&gt;&lt;milestone n="4" type="end" unit="letter"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="end" unit="novel"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="start" unit="backmatter"/&gt;&lt;include href="standOff_Includes/1818_backMatter.xml" parse="xml"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="end" unit="backmatter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">&lt;/head&gt;&lt;milestone n="4" type="end" unit="letter"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="end" unit="novel"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="start" unit="backmatter"/&gt;&lt;include href="standOff_Includes/1823_backMatter.xml" parse="xml"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="end" unit="backmatter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/head&gt;&lt;milestone n="4" type="end" unit="letter"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="end" unit="novel"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="start" unit="backmatter"/&gt;&lt;include href="standOff_Includes/1831_backMatter.xml" parse="xml"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="1" type="end" unit="backmatter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
