<xml>Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me, and to become my
    fellow student; but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader, and saw idleness and
    ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of
    being debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he spoke, I read in
    his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be
    chained to the miserable details of commerce.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p6"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves
    to say the word “Farewell!” It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking
    repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but when at morning’s dawn I
    descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father
    again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her
    entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her
    playmate and friend.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p7"/>
