As a child, I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth, and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists. </rdg></app><app type="invariant"><rdg wit="#f1818">Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
