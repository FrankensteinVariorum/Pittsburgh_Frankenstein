    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p1"/>“S<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p1_hi1"/>OME<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p1_hi1"/> time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could
    not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances,
    each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p1"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p2"/>“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France,
    where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved
    by his equals. His son was bred in the ser<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_290" n="17"/>vice of his
    country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months
    before my arrival, they had lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris,
    surrounded by friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of
    intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p2"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p3"/>“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and
    had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he
    became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that
    Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The
    injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged
    that his religion and wealth, rather than the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_291" n="18"/>crime
    alleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p3"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p4"/>“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were
    uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a
    solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless
    attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
    unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan;
    who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.
    Felix visited the grate at night, and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his
    favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
    by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt; yet <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_292" n="19"/>when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit
    her father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could
    not help owning to his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully
    reward his toil and hazard.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p4"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p5"/>“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of
    Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of
    her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was
    too delicate to accept this offer; yet he looked forward to the probability of the event
    as to the consummation of his happiness.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p5"/>
