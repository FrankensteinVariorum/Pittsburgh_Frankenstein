    the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_092" n="088"/>that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her
    thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her
    father’s, who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his
    intended services towards her father; and at the same time she gently deplored her own
    fate.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p6"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p7"/>“I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in the hovel,
    to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix
    or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them to you, they will prove the truth of my
    tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to
    repeat the substance of them to you.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p7"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p8"/>“Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the
    Turks; recommended by <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_093" n="089"/>her beauty, she had won the
    heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and
    enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she
    was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion, and taught
    her to aspire to higher powers of intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to
    the female followers of Mahomet. This lady died; but her lessons were indelibly
    impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia,
    and the being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to occupy herself with
    puerile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas
    and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian, and remaining in
    a country <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_094" n="090"/>where women were allowed to take a rank
    in society, was enchanting to her.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p8"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p9"/>“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night previous to it, he
    had quitted prison, and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had
    procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously
    communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
    the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part
    of Paris.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p9"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p10"/>“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to
    Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into
    some part of the Turkish dominions.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p10"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p11"/>“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his depar<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_095" n="091"/>ture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise
    that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation
    of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited
    towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another
    through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and
    Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p11"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p12"/>“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes of the youthful
    lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his
    daughter should be united to a Christian; but he feared the resentment of Felix if he
    should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer, if
    he should choose to betray <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_096" n="092"/>him to the Italian
    state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
    to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his
    daughter with him when he departed. His plans were greatly facilitated by the news which
    arrived from Paris.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p12"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p13"/>“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim, and
    spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly
    discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix, and
    roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister,
    lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her whom he
    loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk, that if the
    lat<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_097" n="093"/>ter should find a favourable opportunity for
    escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent
    at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and delivered
    himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this
    proceeding.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p13"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p14"/>“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took
    place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune, and condemned them to a
    perpetual exile from their native country.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p14"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p15"/>“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.
    Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such
    unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and 
    <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_098" n="094"/>impotence, became a traitor to good feeling and
    honour, and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of
    money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p15"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p16"/>“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and rendered him, when I first
    saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have endured poverty, and when this
    distress had been the meed of his virtue, he would have gloried in it: but the
    ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter
    and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter13_div4_div14_p16"/>
