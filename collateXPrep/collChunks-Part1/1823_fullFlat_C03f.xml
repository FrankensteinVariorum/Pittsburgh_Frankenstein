          seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such
          success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue to write to me
          by every opportunity: I may receive your letters (though the chance is very doubtful) on
          some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
          Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.<p eID="novel1_letter2_div2_p8"/>
