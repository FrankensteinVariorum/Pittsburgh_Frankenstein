          but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of

        <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p36"/>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I
          could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt
          the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly
          from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these
          feelings in my answer.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p36"/>
        <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p37"/>“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly
          fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your
          feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken,
          my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to
          my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p37"/>

          the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I
          have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as
          nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be
          engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the
          greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what
          interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my task,
          his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their
          melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his
          face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story; frightful
          the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it—thus!<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p38"/>
