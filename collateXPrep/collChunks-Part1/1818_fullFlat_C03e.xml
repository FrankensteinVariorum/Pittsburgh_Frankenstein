    consolation for my toils which I <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_028" n="016"/>may never know,
    that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is only
    now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully
    severe; but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season;
    so that, perhaps, I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly; you know
    me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of
    others is committed to my care.<p eID="novel1_letter2_div2_p6"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter2_div2_p7"/>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is
    impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable
    and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions,
    to “the land of mist and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_029" n="017"/>snow;” but I shall kill no
    albatross, therefore do not be alarmed for my safety.<p eID="novel1_letter2_div2_p7"/>
