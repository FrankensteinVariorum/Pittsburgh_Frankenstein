      <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p34"/>You may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I
          could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt
          the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly
          from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these
          feelings in my answer.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p34"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p35"/>“I thank you,” he replied, “for <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_049" n="037"/>your sympathy, but
          it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall
          repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to
          interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you;
          nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably
          it is determined.<p eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p35"/>
      <p sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p36"/>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at
          leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I
          am not engaged, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related
          during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will
          doubtless afford you the greatest <hi sID="novel1_letter4_div4_p36_hi1"/>pleasure<hi eID="novel1_letter4_div4_p36_hi1"/>
