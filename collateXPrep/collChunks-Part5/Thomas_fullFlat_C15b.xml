<anchor type="collate" xml:id="C15b"/> My father, who saw in the unhappiness that was
            painted in my face only an exaggeration of that sorrow which I might naturally feel,
            thought that an amusement suited to my taste would be the best means of restoring to me
            my wonted serenity. It was from this cause that he had removed to the country; and,
            induced by the same motive, he now proposed that we should all make an excursion to the
            valley of Chamounix. I had been there before, but Elizabeth and Ernest never had; and
            both had often expressed an earnest desire to see the scenery of this place, which had
            been described to them as so wonderful and sublime. Accordingly we departed from Geneva
            on this tour</xml>
