    <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_016" n="012"/>The weather was uncommonly fine; and if mine had
    been a sorrow to be chased away by any fleeting circumstance, this excursion would
    certainly have had the effect intended by my father. As it was, I was somewhat
    interested in the scene; it sometimes lulled, although it could not extinguish my grief.
    During the first day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the
    mountains at a distance, towards which we gradually advanced. We perceived that the
    valley through which we wound, and which was formed by the river Arve, whose course we
    followed, closed in upon us by degrees; and when the sun had set, we beheld immense
    mountains and precipices overhanging us on every side, and heard the sound of the river
    raging among rocks, and the dashing of water-falls around.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p11"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p12"/>
    <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_017" n="013"/>The next day we pursued our journey upon mules;
    and as we ascended still higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing
    character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous
    Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees, formed a
    scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps,
    whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
    earth, the habitations of another race of beings.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p12"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p13"/>We passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened
    before us, and we began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after we entered
    the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful
    <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_018" n="014"/>and picturesque as that of Servox, through which
    we had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries; but we
    saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; we
    heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avel√¢nche, and marked the smoke of its
    passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the
    surrounding <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p13_hi1"/>aiguilles<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p13_hi1"/>, and its tremendous <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p13_hi2"/>dome<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p13_hi2"/> overlooked the valley.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p13"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p14"/>During this journey, I sometimes joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself to point out to
    her the various beauties of the scene. I often suffered my mule to lag behind, and
    indulged in the misery of reflection. At other times I spurred on the animal before my
    companions, that I might forget them, the world, and, more than all, myself. When at <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_019" n="015"/>a distance, I alighted, and threw myself on the
    grass, weighed down by horror and despair. At eight in the evening I arrived at
    Chamounix. My father and Elizabeth were very much fatigued; Ernest, who accompanied us,
    was delighted, and in high spirits: the only circumstance that detracted from his
    pleasure was the south wind, and the rain it seemed to promise for the next day.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p14"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p15"/>We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not. I remained
    many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning that played above Mont Blanc,
    and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which ran below my window.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div9_p15"/>
