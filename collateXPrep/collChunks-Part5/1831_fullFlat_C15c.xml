  <anchor type="collate" xml:id="C15c"/> about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months
            after the death of Justine; that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The
            weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of
            Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side—the sound of
            the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the <pb xml:id="F1831_v_095" n="79"/>waterfalls around, spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear, or to
            bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements,
            here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley
            assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the
            precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there
            peeping forth from among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was
            augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and
            domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race
            of beings.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p13"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14"/>I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened
            before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after I entered
            the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful
            and picturesque, as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and snowy
            mountains were its immediate boundaries; but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile
            fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the
            falling avalanche, and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and
            magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14_hi1"/>aiguilles<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14_hi1"/>, and its tremendous <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14_hi2"/>dôme<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14_hi2"/> overlooked the
            valley.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p14"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p15"/>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some
            turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days
            gone by, and were associated with the light-hearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds
            whispered in soothing accents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more. Then again the
            kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief, and indulging in
            all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the
            world, my fears, and, more than all, myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted,
            and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p15"/>
          <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter9_div4_div9_p16"/>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme
            fatigue both of body and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_096" n="80"/>of mind which I had endured.
            For a short space of time I remained at the window, watching the pallid lightnings that
            played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its
            noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations:
            when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came, and
            blest the giver of oblivion. <comment text="ebb: centered underscore a few lines               below"/>
