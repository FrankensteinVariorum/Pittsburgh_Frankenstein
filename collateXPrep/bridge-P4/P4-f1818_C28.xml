            CHAPTER 
            V.WE 
            had resolved not to go to London, 
            but 
            to cross 
            the country to 
            Portsmouth, and thence to embark 
            for 
            Havre. I preferred this 
            plan principally because 
            I dreaded to see again those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved 
            Clerval. I thought 
            with horror of seeing 
            again 
            those 
            persons 
            whom 
            we had been accustomed to visit 
            together, and who might 
            make 
            inquiries 
            concerning an 
            event, 
            the very remembrance 
            of which 
            made 
            me again feel 
            the pang 
            I 
            endured when I gazed on his lifeless 
            form 
            in 
            the inn at——.
            As 
            for my 
            father, 
            his desires 
            and 
            exertions 
            were bounded to the again seeing 
            me 
            restored to health and peace of 
            mind. His tenderness and attentions were 
            unremitting; my grief and gloom was 
            obstinate, 
            but he would not despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.
            “Alas! my father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded, if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.”
            My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as caused by 
            delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a feeling that I should be supposed mad, and this for ever chained my tongue, when I would have given the whole world to have confided the fatal secret.
            
            
            Upon 
            this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, 
            “What 
            do you mean, 
            Victor? 
            are you mad? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.”
            “I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.”
            The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland, and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.
            As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence, I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.
            We 
            arrived at Havre on the 8th of 
            May, and 
            instantly proceeded to Paris, 
            where my father had some 
            business 
            which detained us a few weeks. 
            In this 
            city, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:—
