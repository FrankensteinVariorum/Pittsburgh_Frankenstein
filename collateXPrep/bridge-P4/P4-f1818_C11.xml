            CHAPTER V.CLERVAL then put the following letter into my 
            hands.
            To 
            V. 
            FRANKENSTEIN.
            “MY 
            DEAR 
            COUSIN,
            “I 
            cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning your 
            health. We cannot help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals the extent of your 
            disorder: 
            for it is now 
            several months since we have seen 
            your 
            hand-writing; 
            and all this time you have been obliged to dictate 
            your letters to Henry. Surely, Victor, 
            you must have been 
            exceedingly ill; 
            and 
            this makes us 
            all 
            very 
            wretched, 
            as much so 
            nearly as 
            after the death of your dear 
            mother. 
            My uncle 
            was 
            almost persuaded that you were indeed dangerously ill, 
            and 
            could hardly be restrained from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. Clerval always 
            writes that you are getting better; 
            I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own hand-writing; 
            for indeed, 
            indeed, Victor, 
            we are all very 
            miserable 
            on this account. Relieve 
            us from this 
            fear, and we shall 
            be the happiest creatures in the 
            world. 
            Your father’s health is now 
            so vigorous, that he appears 
            ten years younger since last 
            winter. Ernest also is so much improved, 
            that you would hardly 
            know 
            him: he is now nearly 
            sixteen, and has 
            lost that sickly appearance 
            which 
            he had 
            some years 
            ago; he is grown 
            quite 
            robust and active.
            “My 
            uncle and I conversed 
            a long time 
            last night 
            about what 
            profession Ernest should 
            follow. His constant 
            illness 
            when young has deprived 
            him of the habits of application; 
            and now 
            that he enjoys good 
            health, 
            he is continually in the open air, climbing the hills, or rowing on the lake. I 
            therefore 
            proposed that he should be 
            a 
            farmer; 
            which you 
            know, Cousin, 
            is a favourite scheme 
            of 
            mine. A farmer’s 
            is a very healthy 
            happy life; and the least 
            hurtful, 
            or rather the most 
            beneficial 
            profession 
            of 
            any. My 
            uncle had an 
            idea of his 
            being educated 
            as an advocate, 
            that 
            through 
            his 
            interest he 
            might become a judge. 
            But, 
            besides that he is not at all 
            fitted 
            for such an 
            occupation, it is certainly 
            more creditable 
            to 
            cultivate the earth for the sustenance of 
            man, 
            than 
            to be the 
            confidant, 
            and sometimes 
            the 
            accomplice, of his 
            vices; which is the 
            profession 
            of a lawyer. 
            I 
            said, 
            that 
            the 
            employments 
            of a prosperous 
            farmer, 
            if 
            they 
            were not a more 
            honourable, 
            they 
            were 
            at least a happier 
            species of occupation 
            than that of a judge, whose 
            misfortune it was always to meddle 
            with the dark side of human 
            nature. My uncle 
            smiled, and said, 
            that I ought to be an advocate 
            myself, 
            which put an end to the conversation 
            on that 
            subject.
            “And 
            now I must tell you a little 
            story that will 
            please, 
            and perhaps amuse 
            you. Do you not remember Justine Moritz? 
            Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father; but, through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and, after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this; and, when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at her house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
            “After 
            what I have said, 
            I dare say you well 
            remember 
            the heroine of my little tale: 
            for Justine was a great favourite of your’s; and I recollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill 
            humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions, 
            I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid thegreatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.
            “When my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.
            “One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! she wept when she quitted our house: she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace 
            for 
            ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions continually remind me of my dear aunt.
            “I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little wives, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.
            “Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with every 
            body.
            “I have written myself into good spirits, dear cousin; 
            yet I 
            cannot 
            conclude 
            without again anxiously 
            inquiring 
            concerning your 
            health. 
            Dear Victor, if 
            you are not very 
            ill, 
            write 
            yourself, 
            and make your father and all 
            of us 
            happy; or——I 
            cannot bear to 
            think 
            of 
            the 
            other side 
            of the 
            question; 
            my tears already 
            flow. Adieu, my dearest cousin.
            “ELIZABETH 
            LAVENZA.
            “Geneva, 
            March 18th, 
            17—.”
