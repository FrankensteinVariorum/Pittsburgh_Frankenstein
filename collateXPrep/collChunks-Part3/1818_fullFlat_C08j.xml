            equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
            natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is
            on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
            neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist, if
            he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become
            really a man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to
            apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p16"/>

            explained to me the uses of his various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to
            procure, and promising me the use of his own, when I should have advanced far enough in
            the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I
            had requested; and I took my leave.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p17"/>
