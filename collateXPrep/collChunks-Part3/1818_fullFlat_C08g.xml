    <anchor type="collate" xml:id="C08g"/>Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when the
    masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were
    grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
    itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly
    founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of
    little worth.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p12"/>Such were my reflections during the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_084" n="072"/>first two or
    three days spent almost in solitude. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the
    information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could
    not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a
    pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had
    hitherto been out of town.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p12"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p13"/>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
    M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
    appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
    benevolence; a few gray hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
    were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_085" n="073"/>voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his
    lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements
    made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most
    distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the
    science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory
    experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
    shall never forget:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p13"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p14"/>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and
    performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
    be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
    hands seem only made to dabble <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_086" n="074"/>in dirt, and their
    eyes to pour over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They
    penetrate into the recesses of nature, and shew how she works in her hiding places. They
    ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature
    of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can
    command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world
    with its own shadows.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p14"/>
