    excepting Clerval, who spent the last evening with us. He bitterly lamented that he was
    unable to accompany me: but his father could not be persuaded to part with him,
    intending that he should become a partner with him in business, in compliance with his
    favourite theory, that learning was superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life. Henry
    <del sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4_del1"/>had a refined mind; he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased to become his
    father’s partner, but he believed that a man might be a very good trader, and yet
    possess a cultivated understanding.<del eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p4_del1"/>

    future. The next <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_079" n="067"/>morning early I departed. Tears

    months before, when a mother’s blessing would have accompanied me.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p5"/>
