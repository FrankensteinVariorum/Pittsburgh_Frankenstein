    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the most
    melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions,
    continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I was now alone. In the
    university, whither I was going, I must form my own friends, and be my own protector. My
    life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me
    invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval;
    <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_080" n="068"/>these were “old familiar faces;” but I believed
    myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I
    commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired
    the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain
    during my youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my
    station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would,
    indeed, have been folly to repent.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p6"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to
    Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town
    met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend the
    evening as I pleased.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p7"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p8"/>
    <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_081" n="069"/>The next morning I delivered my letters of
    introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal professors, and among others to
    M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked me
    several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science
    appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is true, with fear and trembling,
    the only authors I had ever read upon those subjects. The professor stared: “Have you,”
    he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p8"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/>I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every
    instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have
    burdened your memory with exploded systems, and useless names. Good God! in what <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_082" n="070"/>desert land have you lived, where no one was kind
    enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a
    thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected in this
    enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My
    dear Sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p9"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/>So saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural
    philosophy, which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me, after mentioning that in
    the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon
    natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor,
    would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he missed.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p10"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p11"/>I returned home, not disappointed, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_083" n="071"/>for I had long
    considered those authors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I
    did not feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his recommendation. M.
    Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and repulsive countenance; the
    teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his</xml>
