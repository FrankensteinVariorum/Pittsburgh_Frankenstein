    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/> W<hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/>HEN<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_hi1"/> I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents
    resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto
    attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion
    of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my
    native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day
    resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it
    were, of my future misery. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_074" n="062"/>Elizabeth had caught
    the scarlet fever; but her illness was not severe, and she quickly recovered. During her
    confinement, many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from
    attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard
    that her favourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her society,
    and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past. The consequences
    of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was very
    malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
    death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this <del sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_del1"/>admirable<del eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_del1"/>
    <add sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_add1"/>amiable<add eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1_add1"/> woman did not desert her. She
    joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: “My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of
    future <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_075" n="063"/>happiness were placed on the prospect of
    your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my
    love, you must supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I regret that I am taken
    from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But
    these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
    death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p1"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not
    describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable
    evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on
    the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw
    every day, and whose very existence <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_076" n="064"/>appeared a
    part of our own, can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can
    have been extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can
    be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when
    the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief
    commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connexion; and why
    should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length
    arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays
    upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was
    dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course
    with the rest, and learn to think <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_077" n="065"/>ourselves
    fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p3"/>My journey to Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again
    determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.</xml>
