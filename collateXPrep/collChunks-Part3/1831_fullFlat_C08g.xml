    <anchor type="collate" xml:id="C08g"/>Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very
    different, when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views,
    although futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the enquirer
    seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
    science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur
    for realities of little worth.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p13"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/>Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at
    Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the
    principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the
    information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could
    not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a
    pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had
    hitherto been out of town.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p14"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p15"/>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
    M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
    appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
    benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
    were <pb xml:id="F1831_v_050" n="34"/>nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably
    erect; and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a
    recapitulation of the history of chemistry, and the various improvements made by
    different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished
    discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science, and
    explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments,
    he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never
    forget:—<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p15"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p16"/>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and
    performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
    be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
    hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
    crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature,
    and show how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into the heavens: they have
    discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have
    acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic
    the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter3_div4_div3_p16"/>
