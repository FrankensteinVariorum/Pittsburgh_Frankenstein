    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2"/>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely
    their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house
    in Geneva, and a <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/>campagne<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter2_div4_div2_p2_hi1"/> on Belrive, the eastern shore of the
    lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally
    in the latter, and <pb xml:id="F1831_v_040" n="24"/>the lives of my parents were passed
    in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself
    fervently to a few.
