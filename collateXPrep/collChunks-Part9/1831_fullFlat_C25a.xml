    several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of
    the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a
    secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information
    necessary for the completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of
    introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural
    philosophers.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div19_p1"/>

    afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only
    visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject
    in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I
    could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me,
    and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous
    faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between
    me and my fellow-men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and
    to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div19_p2"/>

    gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him
    an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.</xml>
