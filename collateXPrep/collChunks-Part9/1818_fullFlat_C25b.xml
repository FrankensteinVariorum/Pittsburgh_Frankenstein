    was my sorrowful and dejected mien. I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I
    might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of
    life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,
    alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the
    materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single
    drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was
    an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_028" n="024"/>caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to
    palpitate.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p3"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p4"/>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland,
    who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native
    country, and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong
    our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept
    this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and
    streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
    dwelling-places.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p4"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p5"/>We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We
    accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of
    another month. In this expedition we did not <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_029" n="025"/>intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock,
    and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the
    end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments, and the materials I had collected,
    resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of
    Scotland.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p5"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p6"/>We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in
    its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the
    quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p6"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div20_p7"/>From thence we proceeded to Oxford.</xml>
