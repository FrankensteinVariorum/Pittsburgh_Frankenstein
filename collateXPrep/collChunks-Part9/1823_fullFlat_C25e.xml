    supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we
    delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary
    gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain
    our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
    magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite
    verdure, is spread forth into a <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_388" n="115"/>placid expanse of
    waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes,
    embosomed among aged trees.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div19_p7"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div19_p8"/>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the
    past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my
    youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div19_p8_hi1"/>ennui<hi eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div19_p8_hi1"/>, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of
    what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart,
    and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered
    my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to
    beâ€”a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and intolerable to
    myself.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div19_p8"/>

    among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the
    most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often
    prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of
    the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul
    was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of
    liberty and self sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the
    remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a
    free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling
    and hopeless, into my miserable self.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter18_div4_div19_p9"/>
