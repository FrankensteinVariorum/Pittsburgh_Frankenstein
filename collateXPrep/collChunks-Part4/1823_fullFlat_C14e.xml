    my dear Victor, how much I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_200" n="181"/>am relieved, now that I trust in
    the innocence of this unfortunate girl. I never could again have known peace, if I had been
    deceived in my reliance on her. For the moment that I did believe her guilty, I felt an anguish
    that I could not have long sustained. Now my heart is lightened. The innocent suffers; but she
    whom I thought amiable and good has not betrayed the trust I reposed in her, and I am
        consoled.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p33"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p34"/>Amiable cousin! such were your thoughts, mild
    and gentle as your own dear eyes and voice. But I—I was a wretch, and none ever conceived of the
    misery that I then endured.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p34"/>
