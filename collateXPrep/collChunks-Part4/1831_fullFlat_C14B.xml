    But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.
    I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not
    die!—You, my play-fellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! no! I
    never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p24"/>
