    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p24"/>“Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you confess?
    But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.
    I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not
    die!—You, my play-fellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! no! I
    never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p24"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p25"/>Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said; “that pang is
    past. God raises my weakness, and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad
    and bitter world; and if you remember me, and think of me as of one unjustly condemned,
    I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience
    to the will of Heaven!”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p25"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p26"/>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could
    conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor
    victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt
    not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together,
    uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it
    was, she approached me, and said, “Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope,
    do not believe that I am guilty?”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p26"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p27"/>I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced of your
    innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit
    it.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p27"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p28"/>“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those
    who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a <pb xml:id="F1831_v_089" n="73"/>wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune;
    and I feel as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged by you,
    dear lady, and your cousin.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p28"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p29"/>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the
    resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my
    bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy;
    but her’s also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the
    fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had
    penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me, which nothing could
    extinguish. We stayed several hours with Justine; and it was with great difficulty that
    Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I
    cannot live in this world of misery.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p29"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p30"/>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter
    tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed emotion,
    “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may Heaven, in its
    bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
    suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p30"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p31"/>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the
    judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My
    passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold
    answers, and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died
    away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence
    passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p31"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p32"/>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief
    of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father’s woe, and the desolation of that
    late so smiling home—all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy
    ones; but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise <pb xml:id="F1831_v_090" n="74"/>the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be
    heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would
    spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes—who has no thought nor sense of joy,
    except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances—who would fill the air with
    blessings, and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep—to shed countless tears;
    happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
    pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p32"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter8_div4_div8_p33"/>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those
    I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless
    victims to my unhallowed arts. <comment text="ebb: centered underscore a few lines               below"/>
