    to raise me with thoughts of a better life, and elevate me from the petty cares of this world of
    injustice and strife. Do not you, excellent friend, drive me to despair.”<p

    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26"/>“I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is
    an evil too deep and poignant to admit of consolation, for there is no hope. Yet heaven bless
    thee, my dearest Justine, with resignation, and a confidence elevated beyond this world. Oh! how
    I hate its shows and mock<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_196" n="177"/>eries! when one creature is
    murdered, another is immediately deprived of life in a slow torturing manner; then the
    executioners, their hands yet reeking with the blood of innocence, believe that they have done a
    great deed. They call this <hi sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26_hi1"/>retribution<hi
        eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p26_hi1"/>. Hateful name! When that word is
    pronounced, I know greater and more horrid punishments are going to be inflicted than the
    gloomiest tyrant has ever invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this is not consolation
    for you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in escaping from so miserable a den. Alas!
    I would I were in peace with my aunt and my lovely William, escaped from a world which is
    hateful to me, and the visages of men which I abhor.”<p

    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>Justine smiled languidly. “This, dear lady, is
    despair, and not resign<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_197" n="178"/>ation. I must not learn the lesson
    that you would teach me. Talk of something else, something that will bring peace, and not
    increase of misery.”<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter7_div4_div7_p27"/>
