    in a week from that time, when we might arrange the plan of our future proceedings. This
    letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the
    expiration of two days.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p21"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p22"/>Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect: I
    must pack my chemical instruments; and for that purpose I must enter the room which had
    been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils, the sight of which
    was sickening to me. The next morning, at day-break, I summoned sufficient courage, and
    unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I
    had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had man<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_058" n="054"/>gled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to
    collect myself, and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the
    instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my
    work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants, and I accordingly put them into
    a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them
    into the sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach, employed in
    cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p22"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p23"/>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings
    since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded my promise with a
    gloomy despair, as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I
    now felt as if a film had <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_059" n="055"/>been taken from before
    my eyes, and that I, for the first time, saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours
    did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but
    I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own
    mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the
    basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I banished from my mind every thought that
    could lead to a different conclusion.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p23"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p24"/>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket
    aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was
    perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from
    them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with
    shuddering <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_060" n="056"/>anxiety any encounter with my
    fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly
    overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my
    basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away
    from the spot. The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the
    north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with such
    agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the
    rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
    moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut
    through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p24"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter19_div4_div21_p25"/>
    <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_061" n="057"/>I do not know how long I remained in this
    situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The
    wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I
    found that the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the coast from
    which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found that if I
    again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my
    only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of
    terror. I had no compass with me, and was so little acquainted with the geography of
    this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into
    the wide Atlantic, and feel all the tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the
    immeasurable <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_062" n="058"/>waters that roared and buffeted
    around me. I had already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning thirst,
    a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
    that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea, it was
    to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of
    Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval;</xml>
