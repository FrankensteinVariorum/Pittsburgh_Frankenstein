I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon could <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">arrive, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">arrive; </rdg></app>the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery. <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; </rdg></app>Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">but </rdg></app>her illness was <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">not </rdg></app>severe, and she <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">quickly recovered. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">was in the greatest danger. </rdg></app>During her <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">confinement, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">illness, </rdg></app>many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that <app><rdg wit="#f1831">the life of </rdg></app>her favourite was <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">recovering, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">menaced, </rdg></app>she could no longer <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">debar herself from her society, and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was past. The </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">control her anxiety. She attended her sick bed,—her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper,—Elizabeth was saved, but the </rdg></app>consequences of this imprudence were <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">fatal. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">fatal to her preserver. </rdg></app>On the third day my mother <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">sickened; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">sickened;, </rdg></app>her fever was <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">very malignant, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, </rdg></app>and the looks of her <app><rdg wit="#f1831">medical </rdg></app>attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">admirable woman </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">best of women </rdg></app>did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">myself: “My </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">myself:—“My </rdg></app>children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">your </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">my </rdg></app>younger <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">cousins. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">children. </rdg></app>Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, &lt;pb n="30" xml:id="F1831_v_046"/&gt;is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">evil, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">evil; </rdg></app>the void that presents itself to the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">soul, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">soul; </rdg></app>and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and whose very existence appeared a part of our own, can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished, and the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">connexion; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">connection? </rdg></app>and why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives, when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think ourselves fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">journey to </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">departure for </rdg></app>Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">This period was spent </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me; and, above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She indeed veiled </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">sadly; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">sadly ; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">my mother’s death, and my speedy </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">departure, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">departure; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">depressed our spirits; but Elizabeth endeavoured to renew the spirit of cheerfulness in our little society. Since the death of her aunt, her mind had acquired new firmness and vigour. She determined to fulfil </rdg></app>her <app><rdg wit="#f1831">grief, and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life, and assumed its </rdg></app>duties with <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">the greatest exactness; and she felt that that most imperious duty, of rendering </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call </rdg></app>her uncle and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">cousins happy, had devolved upon her. She consoled me, amused her uncle, instructed my brothers; and I never beheld her </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;pb n="31" xml:id="F1831_v_047"/&gt;cousins. Never was she </rdg></app>so enchanting as at this time, when she <app><rdg wit="#f1818">was continually endeavouring to con&lt;pb n="v1_066" xml:id="F1818_v1_078"/&gt;tribute to the happiness of others, entirely forgetful of herself. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">was continually endeavouring to contribute to the happi&lt;pb n="65" xml:id="F1823_v1_085"/&gt;ness of others, entirely forgetful of herself. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The day of my departure at length arrived. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">I had taken leave of all my friends, excepting Clerval, who </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Clerval </rdg></app>spent the last evening with us. He <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">bitterly lamented that he was unable to accompany me: but </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">had endeavoured to persuade </rdg></app>his father <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">could not be persuaded </rdg></app>to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">part with him, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">permit </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">intending </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">intending, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">that he should become a partner with </rdg></app>him <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">in business, in compliance with his favourite theory, that learning was superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life. Henry had a refined mind; he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">to accompany me, and </rdg></app>to become <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">his father’s partner, but he believed that a man might </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">my fellow student; but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">become </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">be </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">a very good </rdg></app>trader, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">yet possess a cultivated understanding. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little; but when he spoke, I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve, not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We sat <app><rdg wit="#f1818">late, listening to his complaints, and making many little arrangements for the future. The next &lt;pb n="v1_067" xml:id="F1818_v1_079"/&gt;morning early </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">late, listening to his complaints, and making many little arrangements for the future. The next &lt;pb n="67" xml:id="F1823_v1_086"/&gt;morning early </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other, nor persuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said; and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived: but when at morning’s dawn </rdg></app>I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">departed. Tears gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure, and partly because she reflected that the same journey </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">descended to the carriage which </rdg></app>was to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">have taken place three months before, when a mother’s blessing would have accompanied me. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">convey me away, they were all there—my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often, and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure, I was now alone. In <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">the university, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">th e niversity, &lt;comment&gt; RM: sic: image shows this not 'the university', this appears to be the actual typsetting error not OCR error &lt;/comment&gt; </rdg></app>whither I was going, I must form my own friends, and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Clerval;&lt;pb n="v1_068" xml:id="F1818_v1_080"/&gt;these </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Clerval; &lt;pb n="68" xml:id="F1823_v1_087"/&gt;these </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Clerval; these </rdg></app>were “old familiar faces;” but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my &lt;pb n="32" xml:id="F1831_v_048"/&gt;station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted, and was conducted to my solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a visit to some of the principal <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">professors, and among others </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">professors. Chance—or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first </rdg></app>to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">received me with politeness, and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">was an uncouth man, but deeply embued in the secrets of his science. He </rdg></app>asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">mentioned, it is true, with fear and trembling, the only </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">replied carelessly; and, partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchymists as the principal </rdg></app>authors I had <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">ever read upon those subjects. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">studied. </rdg></app>The professor stared: “Have you,” he said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">systems, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">systems </rdg></app>and useless names. Good God! in what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I little <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">expected </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">expected, </rdg></app>in this enlightened and scientific <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">age </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">age, </rdg></app>to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Sir, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sir, </rdg></app>you must begin your studies entirely anew.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So saying, he <app><rdg wit="#f1818">stepped </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">stept </rdg></app>aside, and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy, which he desired me to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">procure, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">procure; </rdg></app>and dismissed me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow-professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">missed. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">omitted. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;pb n="33" xml:id="F1831_v_049"/&gt;I returned home, not disappointed, for <app><rdg wit="#f1831">I have said that </rdg></app>I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">had so strongly </rdg></app>reprobated; but I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">did not feel much </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">returned, not at all the more </rdg></app>inclined to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">study the books which I procured at his recommendation. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">recur to these studies in any shape. </rdg></app>M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and <app><rdg wit="#f1831">a </rdg></app>repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">doctrine. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child, I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth, and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists. </rdg></app>Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">inquirer </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">enquirer </rdg></app>seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Such were my reflections during the first two or three days <app><rdg wit="#f1831">of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly </rdg></app>spent <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">almost in solitude. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">in becoming acquainted with the localities, and the principal residents in my new abode. </rdg></app>But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">said </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">said, </rdg></app>of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">grey </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">gray </rdg></app>hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were &lt;pb n="34" xml:id="F1831_v_050"/&gt;nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">chemistry </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">chemistry, </rdg></app>and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:— &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to <app><rdg wit="#f1818">pour </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">pore </rdg></app>over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">shew </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">show </rdg></app>how she works in her hiding places. They ascend into the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">heavens; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">heavens: </rdg></app>they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">ahd </rdg></app>even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">I departed highly pleased with the professor and his lecture, and paid him a visit the same evening. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of fate, enounced to destroy me. As he went on, I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being: chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein,—more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream. There only &lt;pb n="35" xml:id="F1831_v_051"/&gt;remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies, and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day, I paid M. Waldman a visit. </rdg></app>His manners in private were even more <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">mild and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mild,and </rdg></app>attractive than in public; for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture, which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. <app><rdg wit="#f1831">I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow-professor. </rdg></app>He heard with attention <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">my </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">the </rdg></app>little narration concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Agrippa, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Agrippa </rdg></app>and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said, that “these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names, <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and </rdg></app>arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation; and then added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and I, at the same time, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I </rdg></app>requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be <app><rdg wit="#f1818">made; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">made: </rdg></app>it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry <app><rdg wit="#f1818">chemist, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">chemist </rdg></app>if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely a petty ex&lt;pb n="36" xml:id="F1831_v_052"/&gt;perimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and promising me the use of his <app><rdg wit="#f1818">own, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">own </rdg></app>when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">mechanism. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mechauism. </rdg></app>He also gave me the list of books which I had requested; and I took my leave. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thus ended a day memorable to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">me; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">me: </rdg></app>it decided my future destiny. <app><rdg wit="#f1818">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="2" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pb n="78" xml:id="F1823_v1_097"/&gt;&lt;milestone n="2" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;comment&gt; ebb: centered underscore a few lines below &lt;/comment&gt;&lt;milestone n="3" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
