Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">agony. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">anguish. </rdg></app>His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones, and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">expression </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">eKpsession </rdg></app>of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;pb n="189" xml:id="F1831_v_205"/&gt;His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the simplest truth; yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he <app><rdg wit="#f1818">shewed </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">showed </rdg></app>me, and the apparition of the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">monster, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">monster </rdg></app>seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has then really <app><rdg wit="#f1818">existence; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">existence! </rdg></app>I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">creature’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">creature's </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">formation; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">formation: </rdg></app>but on this point he was impenetrable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Are you mad, my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">friend?” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">friend?“ </rdg></app>said <app><rdg wit="#f1818">he, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">he; </rdg></app>“or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Or to what do your questions tend? </rdg></app>Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them, and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up by the interest for my guest, which this tale, and his own elevated and gentle <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">manners </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">manners, </rdg></app>have created. I wish to soothe him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered <app><rdg wit="#f1818">feelings </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">spirit </rdg></app>to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes, that, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries, or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">real </rdg></app>beings <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">themselves </rdg></app>who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Our conversations are not always confined to his own &lt;pb n="190" xml:id="F1831_v_206"/&gt;history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">he </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">be </rdg></app>relates a pathetic incident, or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">ruin. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">ruin! </rdg></app>He seems to feel his own worth, and the greatness of his fall. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “When younger,” said he, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">“I </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">“ </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">felt as if </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">I </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">were </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">believed myself </rdg></app>destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me, when others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless <app><rdg wit="#f1818">&lt;pb n="v3_160" xml:id="F1818_v3_164"/&gt;grief </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">&lt;pb n="248" xml:id="F1823_v2_521"/&gt;grief; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">grief </rdg></app>those talents that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this <app><rdg wit="#f1818">feeling, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">thought, </rdg></app>which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing; and, like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. <app><rdg wit="#f1823">' </rdg></app>I trod heaven in my thoughts, now <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">exulting </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">exalting </rdg></app>in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">recognize </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">recognise </rdg></app>me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">sympathize </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sympathise </rdg></app>with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one; but, I fear, I have gained him only to &lt;pb n="191" xml:id="F1831_v_207"/&gt;know his value, and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">towards </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">towards, </rdg></app>so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties, and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was; or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds, which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">eradicated; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">eradicated: </rdg></app>and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been <app><rdg wit="#f1818">shewn </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">shown </rdg></app>early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be <app><rdg wit="#f1818">invaded </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">contemplated </rdg></app>with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not <app><rdg wit="#f1818">only&lt;pb n="v3_163" xml:id="F1818_v3_167"/&gt;through </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">only &lt;pb n="251" xml:id="F1823_v2_524"/&gt;through </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">only through </rdg></app>habit and association, but from their own merits; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">and, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and </rdg></app>wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth, and the conversation of Clerval, will be ever whispered in my ear. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">They </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">They, </rdg></app>are dead; and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled, and I may die.” &lt;/p&gt; </p>
