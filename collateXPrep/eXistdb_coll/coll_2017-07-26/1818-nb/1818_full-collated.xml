      <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by
        Dr. Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of impossible
        occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to
        such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not
        considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_008" n="viii"/>which the interest of the story depends is exempt from
        the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the
        novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact,
        affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more
        comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can
        yield.</p>
      <p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary principles of human nature,
        while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their combinations. The <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, the tragic poetry of Greece,—Shakespeare, in the <hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mid<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_009" n="ix"/>summer Night’s
          Dream</hi>,—and most especially Milton, in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, conform to
        this rule; and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his
        labours, may, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from
        the adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the
        highest specimens of poetry.</p>
      <p>The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual conversation. It was
        commenced partly as a source of amusement, and partly as an expedient for exercising any
        untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled with these, as the work pro<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_010" n="x"/>ceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in
        which whatever moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall
        affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the
        enervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition of the
        amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions
        which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be
        conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn
        from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
      <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_011" n="xi"/>It is a subject also of additional interest to the
        author, that this story was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally
        laid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the
        environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a
        blazing wood fire, and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts,
        which happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of
        imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more
        acceptable to the public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_012" n="xii"/>myself agreed to write each a story, founded on some
        supernatural occurrence.</p>
      <p>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me on a journey among
        the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which they present, all memory of their
        ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one which has been completed.</p>

        <p>St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.</p>
        <p>Y<hi rend="smallcaps">OU</hi> will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
          commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I
          arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare, and
          increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
        <p>I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of Peters<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_014" n="002"/>burgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my
          cheeks, which braces my nerves, and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling?
          This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a
          foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my day dreams become
          more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost
          and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and
          delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the
          horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will
          put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing
          over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_015" n="003"/>and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the
          habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phænomena of
          the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be
          expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which
          attracts the needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require only
          this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my
          ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread
          a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are
          sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this
          laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_016" n="004"/>in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up
          his native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the
          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by
          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many
          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all
          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
        <p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel
          my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes so
          much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its
          intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_017" n="005"/>early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of
          the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific
          Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember, that a history of all
          the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle Thomas’s
          library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes
          were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I
          had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle
          to allow me to embark in a sea-faring life.</p>
        <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions
          entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_018" n="006"/>and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own
          creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of
          Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how
          heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my
          cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>
        <p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now,
          remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by
          inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the
          North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked
          harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_019" n="007"/>nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
          branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest
          practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler,
          and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when my captain
          offered me the second dignity in the vessel, and entreated me to remain with the greatest
          earnestness; so valuable did he consider my services.</p>
        <p>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might
          have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth
          placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My
          courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_020" n="008"/>and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and
          difficult voyage; the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not
          only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when their’s are
          failing.</p>
        <p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the
          snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than
          that of an English stage-coach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapt in furs, a
          dress which I have already adopted; for there is a great difference between walking the
          deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from
          actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road
          between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_021" n="009"/>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight
          or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by
          paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary
          among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the
          month of June: and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?
          If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I
          fail, you will see me again soon, or never.<anchor id="struct1b"/></p>

        <p>Archangel, 28th March, 17—.</p>
        <p>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow; yet a second step
          is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my
          sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are
          certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</p>
        <p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the absence of the
          object of which I <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_023" n="011"/>now feel as a most severe evil. I
          have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be
          none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to
          sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a
          poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could
          sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear
          sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
          courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are
          like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of
          your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of difficul<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_024" n="012"/>ties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am
          self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common, and read
          nothing but our uncle Thomas’s books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the
          celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power
          to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the
          necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I
          am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate than many school-boys of fifteen. It is
          true that I have thought more, and that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent;
          but they want (as the painters call it) <hi rend="italic">keeping;</hi> and I greatly need
          a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_025" n="013"/>enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.</p>
        <p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean,
          nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the
          dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a
          man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory. He is an
          Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by
          cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted
          with him on board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily
          engaged him to assist in my enterprise.</p>
        <p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_026" n="014"/>the ship for his gentleness, and the mildness of his
          discipline. He is, indeed, of so amiable a nature, that he will not hunt (a favourite, and
          almost the only amusement here), because he cannot endure to spill blood. He is, moreover,
          heroically generous. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune;
          and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to
          the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
          tears, and, throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the
          same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never
          consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of
          the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_027" n="015"/>already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the
          remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains
          of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman’s father
          to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking
          himself bound in honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted
          his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to
          her inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he has
          passed all his life on board a vessel, and has scarcely an idea beyond the rope and the
          shroud.</p>
        <p>But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a
          consolation for my toils which I <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_028" n="016"/>may never know,
          that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is only
          now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully
          severe; but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season;
          so that, perhaps, I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly; you know
          me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of
          others is committed to my care.</p>
        <p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is
          impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable
          and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions,
          to “the land of mist and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_029" n="017"/>snow;” but I shall kill no
          albatross, therefore do not be alarmed for my safety.</p>
        <p>Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most
          southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to
          look on the reverse of the picture. Continue to write to me by every opportunity: I may
          receive your letters (though the chance is very doubtful) on some occasions when I need
          them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection,
          should you never hear from me again.</p>

        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">MY DEAR SISTER</hi>,</p>
        <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">WRITE</hi> a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well
          advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its
          homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land,
          perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold, and apparently
          firm of purpose; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indi<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_031" n="019"/>cating the dangers of the region towards which we are
          advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is
          the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which
          blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a
          degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.</p>
        <p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us, that would make a figure in a letter. One or two
          stiff gales, and the breaking of a mast, are accidents which experienced navigators
          scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content, if nothing worse happen to us
          during our voyage.</p>
        <p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as your’s, I will not
          rashly encounter dan<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_032" n="020"/>ger. I will be cool,

        <p>August 5th, 17—.</p>
        <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although
          it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your
          possession.</p>
        <p>Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on
          all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she floated. Our situation was
          somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We
          accordingly lay to, hoping that some <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_034" n="022"/>change would
          take place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>
        <p>About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction,
          vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades
          groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange
          sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own
          situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on
          towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man,
          but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the
          rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
          inequalities of the ice.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_035" n="023"/>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We
          were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to
          denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
          ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest
          attention.</p>
        <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice
          broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in
          the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I
          profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>
        <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the
          sailors busy on one side <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_036" n="024"/>of the vessel, apparently
          talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before,
          which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog
          remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to
          enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
          some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here
          is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”</p>
        <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.
          “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me
          whither you are bound?”</p>
        <p>You may conceive my astonishment <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_037" n="025"/>on hearing such a
          question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have
          supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for
          the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a
          voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
          Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would
          have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by
          fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry
          him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We
          accordingly <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_038" n="026"/>brought him back to the deck, and
          restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small
          quantity. As soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed
          him near the chimney of the kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little
          soup, which restored him wonderfully.</p>
        <p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared that his
          sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I
          removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never
          saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and
          even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_039" n="027"/>towards him, or does him any the most trifling
          service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and
          sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and
          sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses
          him.</p>
        <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished
          to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle
          curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire
          repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so
          strange a vehicle?</p>
        <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_040" n="028"/>replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”<anchor id="struct4b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct5a"/><app id="var3"><lem>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in</lem></app> the <app id="var4"><lem>same fashion?”</lem></app><anchor id="struct5b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct6a"/>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs
          drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”</p>
        <p>This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning
          the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone
          with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these
          good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”</p>
        <p>“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
          inquisitiveness of mine.”</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_041" n="029"/>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
          situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”</p>
        <p>Soon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed
          the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the
          ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of
          safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>
        <p>From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge
          which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far
          too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. But I have promised that some one
          should watch for him, and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in
          sight.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_042" n="030"/>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange
          occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is
          very silent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his
          manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him,
          although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to
          love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and
          compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
          so attractive and amiable.</p>
        <p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide
          ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should
          have been <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_043" n="031"/>happy to have possessed as the brother of
          my heart.</p>
        <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
          incidents to record.</p>
        <anchor xml:id="C06"/>
        <p>August 13th, 17—.</p>
        <p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my
          pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery
          without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so
          cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet
          they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.</p>
        <p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently
          watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although un<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_044" n="032"/>happy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he
          interests himself deeply in the employments of others. He has asked me many questions
          concerning my design; and I have related my little history frankly to him. He appeared
          pleased with the confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall
          find exceedingly useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to
          spring solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who
          surround him. He is often overcome by gloom, and then he sits by himself, and tries to
          overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass from him like
          a cloud from before the sun, though his dejection never leaves him. I have endeavoured to
          win his confidence; and I trust that I have suc<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_045" n="033"/>ceeded. One day I mentioned to him the desire I had always felt of finding a friend who
          might sympathize with me, and direct me by his counsel. I said, I did not belong to that
          class of men who are offended by advice. “I am self-educated, and perhaps I hardly rely
          sufficiently upon my own powers. I wish therefore that my companion should be wiser and
          more experienced than myself, to confirm and support me; nor have I believed it impossible
          to find a true friend.”</p>
        <p>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger, “in believing that friendship is not only a
          desirable, but a possible acquisition. I once had a friend, the most noble of human
          creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and
          the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_046" n="034"/>every thing, and cannot begin life anew.”</p>
        <p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched
          me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.</p>
        <p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of
          nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions,
          seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double
          existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet when he has
          retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo around him,
          within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p>
        <p>Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wan<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_047" n="035"/>derer? If you do, you must have certainly lost that
          simplicity which was once your characteristic charm. Yet, if you will, smile at the warmth
          of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating them.</p>
        <p>August 19th, 17—.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have
          suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, once, that the memory of
          these evils should die with me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek
          for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of
          your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the
          relation of my misfortunes will be useful to you, yet, if you are inclined, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_048" n="036"/>listen to my tale. I believe that the strange
          incidents connected with it will afford a view of nature, which may enlarge your faculties
          and understanding. You will hear of powers and occurrences, such as you have been
          accustomed to believe impossible: but I do not doubt that my tale conveys in its series
          internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”</p>
        <p>You may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I
          could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt
          the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly
          from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these
          feelings in my answer.</p>
        <p>“I thank you,” he replied, “for <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_049" n="037"/>your sympathy, but
          it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall
          repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to
          interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you;
          nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably
          it is determined.</p>
        <p>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at
          leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I
          am not engaged, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related
          during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will
          doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but to me, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_050" n="038"/>who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what interest and
          sympathy shall I read it in some future day!</p>

          <head><anchor id="struct9a"/>CHAPTER I.</head>
          <p> I <hi rend="smallcaps">AM</hi> by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most
            distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
            syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
            He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to
            public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_052" n="040"/>his country; and it was not until the decline of
            life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on the state sons who might carry his
            virtues and his name down to posterity.</p>
          <p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
            relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing
            state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was
            Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
            poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
            his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable
            manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown
            and in wretchedness. My father loved Beau<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_053" n="041"/>fort with
            the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
            circumstances. He grieved also for the loss of his society, and resolved to seek him out
            and endeavour to persuade him to begin the world again through his credit and
            assistance.</p>
          <p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before
            my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,
            which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and
            despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the
            wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some
            months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a mer<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_054" n="042"/>chant’s house. The interval was consequently spent
            in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for
            reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three
            months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
          <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that
            their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
            support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
            rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by
            various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>
          <p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_055" n="043"/>was more entirely occupied in attending him; her
            means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms,
            leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt by
            Beaufort’s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a
            protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and after the
            interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection
            of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.</p>
          <p>When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so occupied by the
            duties of his new situation, that he relinquished many of his public employments, and
            devoted himself to the education of his children. Of these I was the eldest, and the
            destined suc<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_056" n="044"/>cessor to all his labours and utility.
            No creature could have more tender parents than mine. My improvement and health were
            their constant care, especially as I remained for several years their only child. But
            before I continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when I was
            four years of age.</p>
          <p>My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early in life an
            Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage, she had accompanied her husband into his
            native country, and for some years my father had very little communication with her.
            About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter
            from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an Italian lady, and
            requesting my father to take charge of the in<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_057" n="045"/>fant
            Elizabeth, the only child of his deceased sister. “It is my wish,” he said, “that you
            should consider her as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her mother’s fortune is
            secured to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping. Reflect upon this
            proposition; and decide whether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her
            being brought up by a stepmother.”</p>
          <p>My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he might accompany the
            little Elizabeth to her future home. I have often heard my mother say, that she was at
            that time the most beautiful child she had ever seen, and shewed signs even then of a
            gentle and affectionate disposition. These indications, and a desire to bind as closely
            as possible the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to consider <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_058" n="046"/>Elizabeth as my future wife; a design which she
            never found reason to repent.</p>
          <p>From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my
            friend. She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect.
            Although she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her
            disposition uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could
            submit with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was
            luxuriant, yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her
            mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness.
            Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she
            appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_059" n="047"/>her understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on her,
            as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind
            united to so little pretension.<anchor id="struct9b"/></p>

            very dissimilitude. I was more calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my temper
            was not so yielding. My application was of longer endurance; but it was not so severe

            constantly with us. He went to school with me, and generally passed the afternoon at our
            house: for being an only child, and destitute of companions at home, his father was well
            pleased that he should find associates at our house; and we were never completely happy
            when Clerval was absent.</p>
          <p>I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had
            tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and
            narrow reflections upon self. But, in drawing the picture of my early days, I must not
            omit to record those events which led, by in<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_063" n="051"/>sensible steps to my after tale of misery: for when I would account to myself for the
            birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a
            mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it
            proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and
            joys.<anchor id="struct13b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var76"><lem>Natural</lem></app> philosophy <app id="var77"><lem>is</lem></app> the genius that has regulated my <app id="var78"><lem>fate;</lem></app> I <app id="var79"><lem>desire therefore,</lem></app> in
            this <app id="var80"><lem>narration,</lem></app> to state those facts which led to my <app id="var81"><lem>predilection</lem></app> for that science. When
            I was <app id="var82"><lem>thirteen</lem></app> years <app id="var83"><lem>of age,</lem></app> we all went on a party of pleasure to <app id="var84"><lem>the</lem></app> baths near
            <app id="var85"><lem>Thonon: the inclemency</lem></app> of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In
            this house I chanced to <app id="var86"><lem>find</lem></app> a <app id="var87"><lem>volume</lem></app> of the <app id="var88"><lem>works</lem></app> of <app id="var89"><lem>Cornelius</lem></app> Agrippa. <app id="var90"><lem>I</lem></app> opened it
            with <app id="var91"><lem>apathy;</lem></app> the theory <app id="var92"><lem>which</lem></app> he <app id="var93"><lem>attempts</lem></app> to <app id="var94"><lem>demonstrate,</lem></app> and the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_064" n="052"/>wonderful facts <app id="var95"><lem>which</lem></app> he <app id="var96"><lem>relates,</lem></app> soon changed this
            feeling into <app id="var97"><lem>enthusiasm.</lem></app> A new light <app id="var98"><lem>seemed to dawn</lem></app> upon my <app id="var99"><lem>mind; and,</lem></app> bounding with
            <app id="var100"><lem>joy,</lem></app> I communicated my discovery to my father. I cannot help <app id="var101"><lem>remarking here the</lem></app> many
            opportunities <app id="var102"><lem>instructors possess</lem></app> of directing the attention of their pupils to useful
            knowledge, which they utterly neglect. My father looked carelessly at the <app id="var103"><lem>title-page</lem></app> of
            my <app id="var104"><lem>book,</lem></app> and <app id="var105"><lem>said,</lem></app> “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! <app id="var106"><lem>My</lem></app> dear <app id="var107"><lem>Victor,</lem></app> do not waste your time upon
            <app id="var108"><lem>this;</lem></app> it is sad <app id="var109"><lem>trash.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><app id="var110"><lem>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the
            principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that</lem></app> a modern system of science
            had been <app id="var111"><lem>introduced,</lem></app> which possessed much greater <app id="var112"><lem>powers</lem></app> than the <app id="var113"><lem>ancient,</lem></app> because the
            powers of the <app id="var114"><lem>latter</lem></app> were <app id="var115"><lem>chimerical,</lem></app> while <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_065" n="053"/>those
            of the <app id="var116"><lem>former were</lem></app> real and practical; under such <app id="var117"><lem>circumstances,</lem></app> I should certainly have
            thrown Agrippa aside, <app id="var118"><lem>and,</lem></app> with my imagination warmed as it <app id="var119"><lem>was, should</lem></app> probably have
            <app id="var120"><lem>applied</lem></app> myself to <app id="var121"><lem>the</lem></app> more <app id="var122"><lem>rational</lem></app> theory of chemistry which has <app id="var123"><lem>resulted</lem></app> from modern
            <app id="var124"><lem>discoveries.</lem></app> It is even <app id="var125"><lem>possible,</lem></app> that the train of my ideas <app id="var126"><lem>would</lem></app> never have <app id="var127"><lem>received
            the</lem></app> fatal impulse <app id="var128"><lem>that</lem></app> led <app id="var129"><lem>to</lem></app> my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my
            volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with <app id="var130"><lem>its</lem></app> contents; and I continued
            to read with the greatest <app id="var131"><lem>avidity.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct14a"/>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and
            afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of

            these secret stores of knowledge to my father, yet his indefinite censure of my
            favourite Agrippa always withheld me. I disclosed my discoveries to Elizabeth,
            therefore, under a promise of strict secrecy; but she did not interest herself in the
            subject, and I was left by her to pursue my studies alone.<anchor id="struct14b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var132"><lem type="empty"/></app>It may appear very <app id="var133"><lem>strange,</lem></app> that a <app id="var134"><lem>disciple</lem></app> of Albertus Magnus should arise in the

            the lectures given at <app id="var137"><lem>the schools of Geneva.</lem></app> My dreams were therefore undisturbed by

          <p><app id="var150"><lem>Nor</lem></app> were these my only <app id="var151"><lem>visions. The</lem></app> raising of ghosts or devils <app id="var152"><lem>was a</lem></app> promise liberally
            accorded by <app id="var153"><lem>my</lem></app> favourite <app id="var154"><lem>authors,</lem></app> the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; <app id="var155"><lem>and</lem></app> if

          <p><anchor id="struct16a"/>The natural phænomena that take place every day before our eyes did not escape my
            examinations. Distillation, and the wonderful effects of steam, processes of which my

            was <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_068" n="056"/>engaged by some experiments on an air-pump,
            which I saw employed by a gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting.</p>
          <p>The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several other points served to

            Elizabeth and I had been his constant nurses: his disposition was gentle, but he was
            incapable of any severe application. William, the youngest of our family, was yet an

            native country. My <app id="var230"><lem>departure</lem></app> was therefore fixed <app id="var231"><lem>at</lem></app> an early <app id="var232"><lem>date; but,</lem></app> before the day
            resolved upon could <app id="var233"><lem>arrive,</lem></app> the first <app id="var234"><lem>misfortune</lem></app> of my life <app id="var235"><lem>occurred—an omen,</lem></app> as it
            <app id="var236"><lem>were,</lem></app> of my future <app id="var237"><lem>misery. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_074" n="062"/>Elizabeth</lem></app> had caught
            the <app id="var238"><lem>scarlet fever;</lem></app> but her illness was not <app id="var239"><lem>severe,</lem></app> and she quickly recovered. During her
            <app id="var240"><lem>confinement,</lem></app> many <app id="var241"><lem>arguments</lem></app> had been urged to persuade my mother <app id="var242"><lem>to</lem></app> refrain from
            <app id="var243"><lem>attending</lem></app> upon her. She <app id="var244"><lem>had, at first,</lem></app> yielded <app id="var245"><lem>to</lem></app> our <app id="var246"><lem>entreaties;</lem></app> but when she <app id="var247"><lem>heard</lem></app>
            that her favourite was recovering, she <app id="var248"><lem>could</lem></app> no longer debar herself from her society,
            and entered her <app id="var249"><lem>chamber</lem></app> long before <app id="var250"><lem>the danger of infection was past. The consequences
            of this imprudence were fatal. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was very
            malignant, and the looks of her attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
            death-bed the fortitude and benignity of this admirable woman did not desert her. She
            joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: “My children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of
            future <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_075" n="063"/>happiness were placed on the prospect of
            your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my
            love, you must supply my place to your younger cousins. Alas! I regret that I am taken
            from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But
            these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
            death, and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var251"><lem>She died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not

            the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she, whom <app id="var256"><lem>we</lem></app> saw
            every day, and whose very existence <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_076" n="064"/>appeared a

            be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first <app id="var263"><lem>days; but</lem></app> when

          <p><app id="var309"><lem>The</lem></app> day of my departure at <app id="var310"><lem>length arrived.</lem></app> I had taken leave of all my <app id="var311"><lem>friends,</lem></app>
            excepting Clerval, who spent the last evening with us. He bitterly <app id="var312"><lem>lamented</lem></app> that he was
            <app id="var313"><lem>unable</lem></app> to accompany <app id="var314"><lem>me: but</lem></app> his father could not <app id="var315"><lem>be</lem></app> persuaded to part with <app id="var316"><lem>him,
            intending</lem></app> that he should <app id="var317"><lem>become</lem></app> a partner with him in <app id="var318"><lem>business, in compliance with his
            favourite theory, that</lem></app> learning was <app id="var319"><lem>superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life. Henry
            had a refined mind; he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased to become</lem></app> his
            <app id="var320"><lem>father’s partner,</lem></app> but he believed that a man might be a very good <app id="var321"><lem>trader,</lem></app> and yet
            <app id="var322"><lem>possess</lem></app> a cultivated <app id="var323"><lem>understanding.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct33a"/>We sat late, listening to his complaints, and making many little arrangements for the
            future. The next <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_079" n="067"/>morning early I departed. Tears
            gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure,
            and partly because she reflected that the same journey was to have taken place three
            months before, when a mother’s blessing would have accompanied me.<anchor id="struct33b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct34a"/> <anchor id="struct34b"/></p>
          <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me <app id="var324"><lem>away,</lem></app> and <app id="var325"><lem>indulged</lem></app> in the most
            melancholy <app id="var326"><lem>reflections. I,</lem></app> who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions,
            continually engaged in <app id="var327"><lem>endeavouring</lem></app> to <app id="var328"><lem>bestow</lem></app> mutual <app id="var329"><lem>pleasure,</lem></app> I was now alone. In the
            <app id="var330"><lem>university,</lem></app> whither I was <app id="var331"><lem>going,</lem></app> I must form my own <app id="var332"><lem>friends,</lem></app> and be my own <app id="var333"><lem>protector.</lem></app> My
            life had hitherto been remarkably <app id="var334"><lem>secluded</lem></app> and <app id="var335"><lem>domestic;</lem></app> and this had given me
            <app id="var336"><lem>invincible</lem></app> repugnance to new <app id="var337"><lem>countenances.</lem></app> I loved my <app id="var338"><lem>brothers, Elizabeth,</lem></app> and <app id="var339"><lem>Clerval;</lem></app>
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_080" n="068"/>these were “old familiar <app id="var340"><lem>faces;”</lem></app> but I believed
            <app id="var341"><lem>myself</lem></app> totally unfitted for the <app id="var342"><lem>company</lem></app> of strangers. Such were my <app id="var343"><lem>reflections</lem></app> as I
            commenced my <app id="var344"><lem>journey; but</lem></app> as I <app id="var345"><lem>proceeded,</lem></app> my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired
            <app id="var346"><lem>the acquisition of knowledge. I had often,</lem></app> when at <app id="var347"><lem>home,</lem></app> thought <app id="var348"><lem>it</lem></app> hard <app id="var349"><lem>to</lem></app> remain
            <app id="var350"><lem>during my youth cooped</lem></app> up in one <app id="var351"><lem>place,</lem></app> and had longed to enter <app id="var352"><lem>the world,</lem></app> and take my
            <app id="var353"><lem>station among</lem></app> other human beings. <app id="var354"><lem>Now</lem></app> my desires were <app id="var355"><lem>complied with, and</lem></app> it <app id="var356"><lem>would,
            indeed,</lem></app> have <app id="var357"><lem>been</lem></app> folly to <app id="var358"><lem>repent.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct35a"/> <anchor id="struct35b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var359"><lem>I had sufficient leisure for these and</lem></app> many other reflections during my journey to

            met my eyes. I <app id="var364"><lem>alighted,</lem></app> and was conducted to my solitary <app id="var365"><lem>apartment,</lem></app> to spend the

          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_081" n="069"/><app id="var366"><lem>The</lem></app> next morning I delivered my letters of
            <app id="var367"><lem>introduction,</lem></app> and paid a visit to some of the principal <app id="var368"><lem>professors,</lem></app> and among others to
            M. <app id="var369"><lem>Krempe, professor</lem></app> of <app id="var370"><lem>natural</lem></app> philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked me
            several questions concerning my progress in the <app id="var371"><lem>different</lem></app> branches of science
            appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is <app id="var372"><lem>true,</lem></app> with fear and trembling,
            the only authors I had <app id="var373"><lem>ever</lem></app> read upon those subjects. The professor <app id="var374"><lem>stared:</lem></app> “Have <app id="var375"><lem>you,”
            he said, “really</lem></app> spent your time in studying such <app id="var376"><lem>nonsense?”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct37a"/>I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every
            instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have
            burdened your memory with exploded systems, and useless names. Good God! in what <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_082" n="070"/>desert land have you lived, where no one was kind
            enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a
            thousand years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected in this
            enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My
            dear Sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”<anchor id="struct37b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct38a"/> <anchor id="struct38b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var377"><lem>So saying,</lem></app> he <app id="var378"><lem>stept</lem></app> aside, and <app id="var379"><lem>wrote</lem></app> down a list of several books <app id="var380"><lem>treating of</lem></app> natural
            <app id="var381"><lem>philosophy,</lem></app> which he desired me to <app id="var382"><lem>procure,</lem></app> and dismissed <app id="var383"><lem>me,</lem></app> after mentioning that <app id="var384"><lem>in</lem></app>
            the beginning of the <app id="var385"><lem>following</lem></app> week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon
            natural philosophy <app id="var386"><lem>in its general relations,</lem></app> and that M. <app id="var387"><lem>Waldman,</lem></app> a <app id="var388"><lem>fellow-professor,</lem></app>
            would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days <app id="var389"><lem>that</lem></app> he missed.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct39a"/>I returned home, not disappointed, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_083" n="071"/>for I had long
            considered those authors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I
            did not feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his recommendation. M.
            Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and repulsive countenance; the
            teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his doctrine. Besides, I had a
            contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when the
            masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were
            grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
            itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly
            founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of
            little worth.<anchor id="struct39b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct40a"/> <anchor id="struct40b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var390"><lem>Such</lem></app> were my reflections during <app id="var391"><lem>the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_084" n="072"/>first</lem></app> two or
            three days <app id="var392"><lem>spent</lem></app> almost in <app id="var393"><lem>solitude. But</lem></app> as the <app id="var394"><lem>ensuing</lem></app> week <app id="var395"><lem>commenced,</lem></app> I thought of the
            <app id="var396"><lem>information which M. Krempe</lem></app> had given me concerning the <app id="var397"><lem>lectures. And</lem></app> although I could
            not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences <app id="var398"><lem>out</lem></app> of a
            <app id="var399"><lem>pulpit,</lem></app> I recollected what he had said of <app id="var400"><lem>M. Waldman,</lem></app> whom I had never <app id="var401"><lem>seen,</lem></app> as he had
            <app id="var402"><lem>hitherto been</lem></app> out of <app id="var403"><lem>town.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct41a"/>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
            M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
            appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
            benevolence; a few gray hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
            were nearly black. His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_085" n="073"/>voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his
            lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements
            made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most
            distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the
            science, and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory
            experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I
            shall never forget:—<anchor id="struct41b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct42a"/> <anchor id="struct42b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var404"><lem>“The</lem></app> ancient teachers of this <app id="var405"><lem>science,”</lem></app> said he, “promised <app id="var406"><lem>impossibilities,</lem></app> and
            performed nothing. The modern masters promise very <app id="var407"><lem>little; they</lem></app> know that metals cannot
            be <app id="var408"><lem>transmuted,</lem></app> and that the elixir <app id="var409"><lem>of life</lem></app> is a <app id="var410"><lem>chimera.</lem></app> But these <app id="var411"><lem>philosophers,</lem></app> whose
            <app id="var412"><lem>hands seem</lem></app> only made to dabble <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_086" n="074"/>in <app id="var413"><lem>dirt,</lem></app> and their
            eyes to <app id="var414"><lem>pour</lem></app> over the microscope or <app id="var415"><lem>crucible,</lem></app> have indeed performed miracles. They
            penetrate into the recesses of <app id="var416"><lem>nature,</lem></app> and <app id="var417"><lem>shew</lem></app> how she <app id="var418"><lem>works in her hiding places. They
            ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature
            of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can
            command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world
            with its own shadows.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct43a"/> <anchor id="struct43b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var419"><lem>I</lem></app> departed highly pleased with the professor and his <app id="var420"><lem>lecture, and</lem></app> paid him a visit the
            same evening. His manners in private were even more mild <app id="var421"><lem>and</lem></app> attractive than in <app id="var422"><lem>public;
            for</lem></app> there was a certain dignity in his <app id="var423"><lem>mien</lem></app> during his <app id="var424"><lem>lecture,</lem></app> which <app id="var425"><lem>in his own house
            was</lem></app> replaced by the greatest <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_087" n="075"/><app id="var426"><lem>affability</lem></app> and
            <app id="var427"><lem>kindness.</lem></app> He heard <app id="var428"><lem>with attention</lem></app> my little narration concerning my <app id="var429"><lem>studies, and</lem></app> smiled
            at the names of Cornelius <app id="var430"><lem>Agrippa,</lem></app> and <app id="var431"><lem>Paracelsus,</lem></app> but without the contempt that <app id="var432"><lem>M.</lem></app>
            Krempe had <app id="var433"><lem>exhibited. He said, that “these were men</lem></app> to <app id="var434"><lem>whose indefatigable zeal modern
            philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left
            to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications, the
            facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
            labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately
            turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”</lem></app> I <app id="var435"><lem>listened to his statement, which was
            delivered without any presumption or affectation; and then added,</lem></app> that his lecture had
            removed my <app id="var436"><lem>prejudices</lem></app> against modern <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_088" n="076"/><app id="var437"><lem>chemists;</lem></app> and
            <app id="var438"><lem>I,</lem></app> at the same <app id="var439"><lem>time, requested</lem></app> his advice concerning the books I ought to <app id="var440"><lem>procure.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct44a"/> <anchor id="struct44b"/></p>
          <p>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application
            equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
            natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is
            on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
            neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist, if
            he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become
            really a man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to
            apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”</p>

          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_089" n="077"/><app id="var441"><lem>He then took me into his laboratory, and
            explained to me the uses of his various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to
            procure, and promising me the use of his own, when I should have advanced far enough in
            the science not to derange their</lem></app> mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I
            had <app id="var442"><lem>requested;</lem></app> and I took my <app id="var443"><lem>leave.</lem></app></p>

            <app id="var448"><lem>occupation.</lem></app> I read with ardour <app id="var449"><lem>those works,</lem></app> so full of genius and <app id="var450"><lem>discrimination, which
            modern inquirers</lem></app> have <app id="var451"><lem>written</lem></app> on these <app id="var452"><lem>subjects.</lem></app> I attended the lectures, and <app id="var453"><lem>cultivated</lem></app>
            the <app id="var454"><lem>acquaintance,</lem></app> of the men of science of the university; and I found even in <app id="var455"><lem>M.</lem></app> Krempe
            a great deal of sound sense <app id="var456"><lem>and</lem></app> real <app id="var457"><lem>information, combined,</lem></app> it is <app id="var458"><lem>true,</lem></app> with a repulsive
            <app id="var459"><lem>physiognomy and</lem></app> manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I
            found <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_091" n="079"/>a true friend. His gentleness was never
            tinged by <app id="var460"><lem>dogmatism;</lem></app> and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good
            <app id="var461"><lem>nature,</lem></app> that banished every idea of <app id="var462"><lem>pedantry.</lem></app> It <app id="var463"><lem>was, perhaps,</lem></app> the amiable character of
            this man that <app id="var464"><lem>inclined</lem></app> me more to <app id="var465"><lem>that</lem></app> branch of <app id="var466"><lem>natural</lem></app> philosophy which he <app id="var467"><lem>professed,</lem></app>
            than an intrinsic love for the science itself. But this <app id="var468"><lem>state of mind had place</lem></app> only in
            the first steps towards <app id="var469"><lem>knowledge:</lem></app> the more fully I entered <app id="var470"><lem>into</lem></app> the <app id="var471"><lem>science,</lem></app> the more
            <app id="var472"><lem>exclusively I pursued</lem></app> it for its own sake. That <app id="var473"><lem>application,</lem></app> which at first had been a
            matter of <app id="var474"><lem>duty and</lem></app> resolution, now became so ardent and <app id="var475"><lem>eager,</lem></app> that the stars often
            <app id="var476"><lem>disappeared in the light of morning whilst</lem></app> I was yet <app id="var477"><lem>engaged</lem></app> in my <app id="var478"><lem>laboratory.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct48a"/> <anchor id="struct48b"/></p>
          <p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved <app id="var479"><lem>ra<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_092" n="080"/>pidly.</lem></app> My ardour was indeed the <app id="var480"><lem>astonishment</lem></app> of the
            <app id="var481"><lem>students;</lem></app> and my <app id="var482"><lem>proficiency,</lem></app> that of the <app id="var483"><lem>masters.</lem></app> Professor Krempe often asked <app id="var484"><lem>me,</lem></app> with
            a sly <app id="var485"><lem>smile,</lem></app> how Cornelius Agrippa went <app id="var486"><lem>on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most
            heartfelt exultation in my progress.</lem></app> Two years passed in this <app id="var487"><lem>manner,</lem></app> during which I
            paid no visit to Geneva, but <app id="var488"><lem>was engaged,</lem></app> heart and <app id="var489"><lem>soul,</lem></app> in the pursuit of some
            <app id="var490"><lem>discoveries,</lem></app> which I hoped to make. <app id="var491"><lem>None</lem></app> but those who have experienced <app id="var492"><lem>them</lem></app> can
            conceive of the enticements of <app id="var493"><lem>science.</lem></app> In other studies you go as far as others have
            <app id="var494"><lem>gone</lem></app> before <app id="var495"><lem>you,</lem></app> and there is nothing more to <app id="var496"><lem>know;</lem></app> but in a scientific pursuit <app id="var497"><lem>there</lem></app> is
            continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of <app id="var498"><lem>moderate capacity, which</lem></app> closely
            pursues one <app id="var499"><lem>study,</lem></app> must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in <app id="var500"><lem>that study; and I,</lem></app> who
              <app id="var501"><lem>con<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_093" n="081"/>tinually sought</lem></app> the attainment of one <app id="var502"><lem>object
            of pursuit,</lem></app> and was <app id="var503"><lem>solely wrapt</lem></app> up <app id="var504"><lem>in this,</lem></app> improved so <app id="var505"><lem>rapidly, that,</lem></app> at the end of
            <app id="var506"><lem>two years,</lem></app> I made <app id="var507"><lem>some discoveries</lem></app> in the improvement of some chemical <app id="var508"><lem>instruments,</lem></app>
            which <app id="var509"><lem>procured</lem></app> me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I <app id="var510"><lem>had arrived</lem></app> at
            this <app id="var511"><lem>point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural
            philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my</lem></app>
            residence <app id="var512"><lem>there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to
            my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct49a"/> <anchor id="struct49b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var513"><lem>One of the phænomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of
            the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself,
            did the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_094" n="082"/>principle of life proceed? It was a bold
            question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things
            are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not
            restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined
            thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy
            which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural
            enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost
            intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I
            became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also
            observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my</lem></app> father
            had taken the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_095" n="083"/>greatest precautions that my mind
            should <app id="var514"><lem>be</lem></app> impressed <app id="var515"><lem>with</lem></app> no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember <app id="var516"><lem>to have</lem></app>
            trembled at a <app id="var517"><lem>tale</lem></app> of <app id="var518"><lem>superstition,</lem></app> or to have feared the apparition of a <app id="var519"><lem>spirit.</lem></app>
            Darkness had no effect upon my <app id="var520"><lem>fancy;</lem></app> and a <app id="var521"><lem>church-yard</lem></app> was to me merely <app id="var522"><lem>the</lem></app> receptacle
            of <app id="var523"><lem>bodies</lem></app> deprived of <app id="var524"><lem>life, which,</lem></app> from being the seat of beauty <app id="var525"><lem>and strength, had</lem></app>
            become food for the worm. <app id="var526"><lem>Now</lem></app> I was <app id="var527"><lem>led</lem></app> to examine the cause <app id="var528"><lem>and</lem></app> progress of this <app id="var529"><lem>decay,</lem></app>
            and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and <app id="var530"><lem>charnel</lem></app> houses. <app id="var531"><lem>My</lem></app> attention was fixed
            upon every <app id="var532"><lem>object the</lem></app> most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. <app id="var533"><lem>I</lem></app> saw
            how the fine form of <app id="var534"><lem>man</lem></app> was <app id="var535"><lem>degraded</lem></app> and <app id="var536"><lem>wasted;</lem></app> I beheld the corruption of death
            succeed to the <app id="var537"><lem>blooming</lem></app> cheek of <app id="var538"><lem>life;</lem></app> I saw how the worm <app id="var539"><lem>inherited</lem></app> the wonders of the
            eye and brain. I <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_096" n="084"/>paused, <app id="var540"><lem>examining</lem></app> and <app id="var541"><lem>analysing
            all the</lem></app> minutiæ of <app id="var542"><lem>causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and
            death to life, until</lem></app> from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon <app id="var543"><lem>me—a</lem></app>
            light so brilliant <app id="var544"><lem>and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the
            immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men
            of genius, who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone
            should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct50a"/> <anchor id="struct50b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var545"><lem>Remember,</lem></app> I am <app id="var546"><lem>not</lem></app> recording the <app id="var547"><lem>vision of</lem></app> a <app id="var548"><lem>madman.</lem></app> <app id="var549"><lem>The</lem></app> sun does not more certainly
            shine in the <app id="var550"><lem>heavens,</lem></app> than that <app id="var551"><lem>which</lem></app> I now <app id="var552"><lem>affirm</lem></app> is true. Some miracle might have
            produced <app id="var553"><lem>it, yet</lem></app> the stages of <app id="var554"><lem>the discovery</lem></app> were distinct and probable. After days and
            nights of incredible <app id="var555"><lem>labour</lem></app> and <app id="var556"><lem>fatigue,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_097" n="085"/>I
            succeeded in discovering the cause of generation <app id="var557"><lem>and life; nay,</lem></app> more, I <app id="var558"><lem>became</lem></app> myself
            capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless <app id="var559"><lem>matter.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct51a"/> <anchor id="struct51b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var560"><lem>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to
            delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at
            the summit of my desires, was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this
            discovery was so great and overwhelming, that all the steps</lem></app> by which I had been
            progressively led to it were <app id="var561"><lem>obliterated,</lem></app> and I <app id="var562"><lem>beheld</lem></app> only the result. What had been

            my <app id="var566"><lem>grasp.</lem></app> Not that, like a magic <app id="var567"><lem>scene,</lem></app> it all opened upon me at <app id="var568"><lem>once:</lem></app> the <app id="var569"><lem>information</lem></app> I
            had obtained was <app id="var570"><lem>of</lem></app> a nature rather <app id="var571"><lem>to</lem></app> direct my <app id="var572"><lem>endeavours so soon as I should point
            them towards <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_098" n="086"/>the object of my search, than to
            exhibit that object already accomplished.</lem></app> I was like the <app id="var573"><lem>Arabian</lem></app> who had been buried
            with the dead, and found a passage to life aided only by one <app id="var574"><lem>glimmering,</lem></app> and <app id="var575"><lem>seemingly

          <p><app id="var576"><lem>I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend,

            concerning the <app id="var586"><lem>manner</lem></app> in which I should <app id="var587"><lem>employ</lem></app> it. Although I <app id="var588"><lem>possessed</lem></app> the capacity of

            <app id="var594"><lem>intricacies</lem></app> of <app id="var595"><lem>fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained</lem></app> a work of inconceivable
            <app id="var596"><lem>difficulty and labour.</lem></app> I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a
            <app id="var597"><lem>being</lem></app> like <app id="var598"><lem>myself</lem></app> or one of simpler organization; <app id="var599"><lem>but</lem></app> my imagination was too much

            animal as complex and wonderful as man. <app id="var603"><lem>The materials at present within</lem></app> my command

            a multitude of reverses;</lem></app> my operations <app id="var608"><lem>might be incessantly baffled, and at last</lem></app> my work
            be <app id="var609"><lem>imperfect: yet, when I considered</lem></app> the improvement <app id="var610"><lem>which</lem></app> every day takes place in
            science and <app id="var611"><lem>mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay
            the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude</lem></app> and <app id="var612"><lem>complexity of</lem></app>
            my <app id="var613"><lem>plan as any argument of its impracticability. It</lem></app> was <app id="var614"><lem>with these feelings</lem></app> that <app id="var615"><lem>I began
            the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance
            to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic
            stature; that is to say, about eight feet</lem></app> in <app id="var616"><lem>height, and proportionably large. After
            having formed this de<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_101" n="089"/>termination, and having spent
            some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var617"><lem>No</lem></app> one can conceive <app id="var618"><lem>the</lem></app> variety of feelings which <app id="var619"><lem>bore</lem></app> me <app id="var620"><lem>onwards, like a hurricane, in
            the first enthusiasm of success. Life</lem></app> and death <app id="var621"><lem>appeared</lem></app> to me ideal bounds, which I
            should first break <app id="var622"><lem>through,</lem></app> and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new
            <app id="var623"><lem>species</lem></app> would bless me as its <app id="var624"><lem>creator</lem></app> and source; many happy and excellent <app id="var625"><lem>natures</lem></app> would

            <app id="var667"><lem>renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned
            to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane
            fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather
            cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery
            and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
            their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the
            slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with
            loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually
            increased, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_104" n="092"/>I brought my work near to a
            conclusion.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct56a"/>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It
            was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest, or
            the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of
            nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
            to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so
            long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well remembered the words of my
            father: “I know that while you are pleased with yourself, you will think of us with
            affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me, if I regard any
            interruption in your correspondence as a proof <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_105" n="093"/>that your other duties are equally neglected.”<anchor id="struct56b"/></p>

            hold of my <app id="var674"><lem>imagination.</lem></app> I <app id="var675"><lem>wished,</lem></app> as it <app id="var676"><lem>were,</lem></app> to <app id="var677"><lem>procrastinate</lem></app> all that related to my
            feelings of <app id="var678"><lem>affection until</lem></app> the great <app id="var679"><lem>object,</lem></app> which swallowed up every habit <app id="var680"><lem>of my

            should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to
            preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never</lem></app> to <app id="var684"><lem>allow passion or a transitory desire to
            disturb his tranquillity. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_106" n="094"/>I do not think that the
            pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply
            yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those
            simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly
            unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the</lem></app> human mind. If this <app id="var685"><lem>rule were always</lem></app>

          <p>My father made no reproach in his <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_107" n="095"/>letters; and
            only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than
            before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch
            the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme
            delight, so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had
            withered before my work drew near to a close; and now every day shewed me more plainly
            how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
            rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade,
            than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a
            slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; a disease that I regretted
            the more because I had hitherto en<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_108" n="096"/>joyed most
            excellent health, and had always boasted of the firmness of my nerves. But I believed
            that exercise and amusement would soon drive away such symptoms; and I promised myself
            both of these, when my creation should be complete.</p>

          <p><app id="var700"><lem>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi></lem></app> was on a dreary night of <app id="var701"><lem>November,</lem></app> that I beheld the
            <app id="var702"><lem>accomplishment of</lem></app> my <app id="var703"><lem>toils. With</lem></app> an anxiety that almost <app id="var704"><lem>amounted</lem></app> to <app id="var705"><lem>agony,</lem></app> I collected
            <app id="var706"><lem>the instruments</lem></app> of life around <app id="var707"><lem>me,</lem></app> that I might <app id="var708"><lem>infuse</lem></app> a spark of being into the
            lifeless <app id="var709"><lem>thing</lem></app> that lay at my feet. It was already one in the <app id="var710"><lem>morning;</lem></app> the rain pattered
            dismally against the <app id="var711"><lem>panes, and</lem></app> my candle was nearly burnt out, <app id="var712"><lem>when,</lem></app> by the glimmer of
            the <app id="var713"><lem>half-extinguished light,</lem></app> I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature <app id="var714"><lem>open; it</lem></app> breathed
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_110" n="098"/>hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its
            <app id="var715"><lem>limbs.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct63a"/>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
            with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in
            proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His
            yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a
            lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only
            formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same
            colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and
            straight black lips.<anchor id="struct63b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var716"><lem>The</lem></app> different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of <app id="var717"><lem>human</lem></app> nature.
            I had worked hard for <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_111" n="099"/>nearly two <app id="var718"><lem>years,</lem></app> for the
            sole purpose of infusing <app id="var719"><lem>life</lem></app> into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of
            rest and <app id="var720"><lem>health.</lem></app> I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now
            that I had <app id="var721"><lem>finished, the beauty of the dream vanished,</lem></app> and breathless horror and disgust
            filled my heart. Unable <app id="var722"><lem>to</lem></app> endure the aspect of the <app id="var723"><lem>being</lem></app> I had created, I rushed out of
            the <app id="var724"><lem>room,</lem></app> and <app id="var725"><lem>continued</lem></app> a long time traversing my <app id="var726"><lem>bed-chamber,</lem></app> unable to compose my mind
            to sleep. At <app id="var727"><lem>length lassitude</lem></app> succeeded to the tumult I had before <app id="var728"><lem>endured;</lem></app> and I threw
            myself on <app id="var729"><lem>the</lem></app> bed in my <app id="var730"><lem>clothes,</lem></app> endeavouring to seek a <app id="var731"><lem>few</lem></app> moments of <app id="var732"><lem>forgetfulness.</lem></app>
            But it was in <app id="var733"><lem>vain:</lem></app> I slept <app id="var734"><lem>indeed,</lem></app> but I was disturbed by the wildest <app id="var735"><lem>dreams.</lem></app> I <app id="var736"><lem>thought
            I saw Elizabeth,</lem></app> in the bloom of <app id="var737"><lem>health,</lem></app> walking in the streets of <app id="var738"><lem>Ingolstadt. Delighted
            and surprised,</lem></app> I em<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_112" n="100"/>braced <app id="var739"><lem>her;</lem></app> but as I imprinted
            the first kiss on her <app id="var740"><lem>lips,</lem></app> they became <app id="var741"><lem>livid</lem></app> with the hue of death; her features
            <app id="var742"><lem>appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a
            shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the
            flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth
            chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the
            moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I beheld the wretch—the
            miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes,
            if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some
            inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did
            not hear; one hand was <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_113" n="101"/>stretched out, seemingly to
            detain me, but I escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard
            belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night,
            walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and
            fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to
            which I had so miserably given life.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct66a"/>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with
            animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished;
            he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it
            became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>
          <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_114" n="102"/>hardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery;
            at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled
            with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment: dreams that had been my food
            and pleasant rest for so long a space, were now become a hell to me; and the change was
            so rapid, the overthrow so complete!<anchor id="struct66b"/></p>

            hour. The porter opened the gates of the <app id="var750"><lem>court,</lem></app> which had that night been my <app id="var751"><lem>asylum,</lem></app> and
            I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick <app id="var752"><lem>steps,</lem></app> as if I <app id="var753"><lem>sought</lem></app> to <app id="var754"><lem>avoid the</lem></app>

          <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to
            ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets, without any clear
            conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of
            fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:</p>

          <p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences
            and carriages usually stopped. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_116" n="104"/>Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained
            some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end
            of the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped
            just where I was standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval,
            who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad
            I am to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my

            in a few words. <app id="var959"><lem>Madame Moritz,</lem></app> her <app id="var960"><lem>mother,</lem></app> was a widow with four <app id="var961"><lem>children,</lem></app> of whom
            <app id="var962"><lem>Justine</lem></app> was the third. This girl had always been the <app id="var963"><lem>favourite</lem></app> of her <app id="var964"><lem>father; but,
            through a strange perversity,</lem></app> her <app id="var965"><lem>mother</lem></app> could <app id="var966"><lem>not</lem></app> endure <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_130" n="118"/><app id="var967"><lem>her, and,</lem></app> after the death of M. <app id="var968"><lem>Moritz,</lem></app> treated her very ill.

            allow her to live at <app id="var972"><lem>her house. The republican institutions of our country have produced
            simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies</lem></app> that
            <app id="var973"><lem>surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its
            inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners
            are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a
            servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties
            of a servant;</lem></app> a <app id="var974"><lem>condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of

            She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her <app id="var1028"><lem>unkindness, but much oftener accused her of
            having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw
            Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now
            at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold wea<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_134" n="122"/>ther, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to us;

            professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill
            befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_137" n="125"/>fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
            beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of
            natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a
            chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this,
            and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he
            perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my
            laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the
            professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the
            astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the
            subject; but, not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_138" n="126"/>changed the subject from my <app id="var1060"><lem>improvement</lem></app> to the

            He meant to <app id="var1065"><lem>please,</lem></app> and <app id="var1066"><lem>he tormented me.</lem></app> I felt as if he had <app id="var1067"><lem>placed carefully,</lem></app> one by

            slow and cruel <app id="var1070"><lem>death.</lem></app> I writhed under his words, yet dared not <app id="var1071"><lem>exhibit</lem></app> the pain I felt.
            Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of

            conversation took a more general turn. I thanked <app id="var1076"><lem>my friend</lem></app> from my heart, but I did not
            speak. I <app id="var1077"><lem>saw plainly</lem></app> that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret

            damps and dews of night: Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the

          <p>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the
            secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to
            prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the

          <p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
            the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my

          <p>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the

            <app id="var1382"><lem>serene; and,</lem></app> as I was unable to <app id="var1383"><lem>rest,</lem></app> I resolved to <app id="var1384"><lem>visit</lem></app> the spot where <app id="var1385"><lem>my</lem></app> poor William
            had been <app id="var1386"><lem>murdered. As</lem></app> I <app id="var1387"><lem>could not pass through the town,</lem></app> I <app id="var1388"><lem>was obliged to cross the lake
            in</lem></app> a <app id="var1389"><lem>boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings
            playing</lem></app> on the <app id="var1390"><lem>summit</lem></app> of <app id="var1391"><lem>Mont Blanc</lem></app> in the most beautiful <app id="var1392"><lem>figures. The storm appeared to
            approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended</lem></app> a <app id="var1393"><lem>low hill,</lem></app> that I might observe <app id="var1394"><lem>its</lem></app>
            progress. It <app id="var1395"><lem>advanced; the heavens were clouded,</lem></app> and I soon felt the rain coming slowly
            in large <app id="var1396"><lem>drops,</lem></app> but its violence quickly <app id="var1397"><lem>increased.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct126a"/>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every
            minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from
            Salêve, the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_158" n="146"/>Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid
            flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a
            vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until
            the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
            Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm
            hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
            promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
            faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain
            to the east of the lake.<anchor id="struct126b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct127a"/> <anchor id="struct127b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1398"><lem>While</lem></app> I watched the <app id="var1399"><lem>storm,</lem></app> so <app id="var1400"><lem>beautiful</lem></app> yet <app id="var1401"><lem>terrific,</lem></app> I wandered <app id="var1402"><lem>on</lem></app> with a hasty <app id="var1403"><lem>step.
            This</lem></app> noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my <app id="var1404"><lem>hands, <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_159" n="147"/>and exclaimed aloud,</lem></app> “William, dear <app id="var1405"><lem>angel!</lem></app> this is
            thy funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these <app id="var1406"><lem>words, I</lem></app> perceived in the gloom <app id="var1407"><lem>a</lem></app> figure
            which stole from behind a clump of trees near <app id="var1408"><lem>me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I
            could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered</lem></app> its
            <app id="var1409"><lem>shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and</lem></app> the deformity of its <app id="var1410"><lem>aspect, more</lem></app> hideous
            <app id="var1411"><lem>than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
            dæmon to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the
            conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination,
            than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean
            against</lem></app> a <app id="var1412"><lem>tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_160" n="148"/>it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have
            destroyed that fair child. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was the murderer! I</lem></app> could <app id="var1413"><lem>not doubt
            it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of
            pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to
            me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill
            that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var1414"><lem>I</lem></app> remained <app id="var1415"><lem>motionless. The</lem></app> thunder <app id="var1416"><lem>ceased;</lem></app> but the rain still <app id="var1417"><lem>continued, and</lem></app> the scene

          <p><anchor id="struct129a"/>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I
            spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the
            weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being
            whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of
            horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
            my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to
            me.<anchor id="struct129b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1438"><lem>Day dawned;</lem></app> and I directed my steps <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_162" n="150"/>towards the
            <app id="var1439"><lem>town.</lem></app> <app id="var1440"><lem>The</lem></app> gates were <app id="var1441"><lem>open;</lem></app> and I hastened to my <app id="var1442"><lem>father’s house. My</lem></app> first thought was to
            <app id="var1443"><lem>discover</lem></app> what I knew of the <app id="var1444"><lem>murderer, and</lem></app> cause instant <app id="var1445"><lem>pursuit</lem></app> to be made. But I paused
            when I <app id="var1446"><lem>reflected on</lem></app> the story <app id="var1447"><lem>that</lem></app> I had to tell. A <app id="var1448"><lem>being</lem></app> whom I myself had <app id="var1449"><lem>formed,</lem></app> and
            endued with life, <app id="var1450"><lem>had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible
            mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the
            time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale
            otherwise so</lem></app> utterly <app id="var1451"><lem>improbable. I</lem></app> well <app id="var1452"><lem>knew that</lem></app> if any other had <app id="var1453"><lem>communicated</lem></app> such a
            <app id="var1454"><lem>relation</lem></app> to <app id="var1455"><lem>me,</lem></app> I should have looked upon it as the ravings of <app id="var1456"><lem>insanity. Besides,</lem></app> the

            to persuade <app id="var1459"><lem>my</lem></app> relatives to commence <app id="var1460"><lem>it. <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_163" n="151"/>Besides,
            of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
            overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to
            remain silent.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct132a"/>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants
            not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of
            rising.<anchor id="struct132b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1461"><lem>Six</lem></app> years had <app id="var1462"><lem>elapsed, passed</lem></app> as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in

            Beloved and respectable parent! <app id="var1463"><lem>He</lem></app> still remained to me. I gazed on <app id="var1464"><lem>the</lem></app> picture of my
            <app id="var1465"><lem>mother,</lem></app> which stood over the mantlepiece. It was an historical <app id="var1466"><lem>subject,</lem></app> painted <app id="var1467"><lem>at my
            father’s desire,</lem></app> and represented Caroline <app id="var1468"><lem>Beaufort</lem></app> in an ago<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_164" n="152"/>ny of <app id="var1469"><lem>despair,</lem></app> kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was
            rustic, <app id="var1470"><lem>and</lem></app> her cheek <app id="var1471"><lem>pale;</lem></app> but there was an air of dignity and <app id="var1472"><lem>beauty,</lem></app> that hardly
            <app id="var1473"><lem>permitted</lem></app> the <app id="var1474"><lem>sentiment</lem></app> of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of <app id="var1475"><lem>William;</lem></app> and my
            tears flowed when I looked upon <app id="var1476"><lem>it. While</lem></app> I was thus <app id="var1477"><lem>engaged,</lem></app> Ernest <app id="var1478"><lem>entered:</lem></app> he had
            heard me <app id="var1479"><lem>arrive,</lem></app> and hastened to welcome me. He expressed <app id="var1480"><lem>a sorrowful</lem></app> delight <app id="var1481"><lem>to see me:
            “Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and
            then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. But we are now unhappy; and, I am
            afraid, tears instead of smiles will be your welcome. Our father looks so sorrowful:
            this dreadful event seems to have revived in his mind his grief on the death of Mamma.
            Poor Elizabeth also is quite inconsolable.” Er<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_165" n="153"/>nest
            began to weep as he said these words.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var1482"><lem>“Do not,”</lem></app> said I, “welcome me thus; try to be more <app id="var1483"><lem>calm,</lem></app> that I may not <app id="var1484"><lem>be absolutely</lem></app>
            miserable the moment I enter my father’s house after so long an absence. <app id="var1485"><lem>But,</lem></app> tell me,

          <p><anchor id="struct135a"/>“She indeed requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my

          <p>“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him?
            It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a
            mountain-stream with a straw.”</p>
          <p>“I do not know what you mean; but we were all very unhappy when <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_166" n="154"/>she was discovered. No one would believe it at
            first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.
            Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the
            family, could all at once become so extremely wicked?”</p>
          <p>“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one

          <p>“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced

          <p><anchor id="struct138a"/> <anchor id="struct138b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1489"><lem>He related that,</lem></app> the <app id="var1490"><lem>morning on which the murder of poor William had <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_167" n="155"/>been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and
            confined to her bed; and, after several days, one of the servants, happening</lem></app> to examine
            the apparel she had worn on the night of the <app id="var1491"><lem>murder, had</lem></app> discovered in her pocket the
            picture of my <app id="var1492"><lem>mother,</lem></app> which had been judged to be the <app id="var1493"><lem>temptation</lem></app> of the murderer. The
            servant instantly shewed it to one of the others, <app id="var1494"><lem>who,</lem></app> without saying a word to any of
            the <app id="var1495"><lem>family,</lem></app> went to a <app id="var1496"><lem>magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.
            On</lem></app> being charged with the <app id="var1497"><lem>fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure
            by her extreme confusion of manner.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct139a"/>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You
            are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_168" n="156"/>At that instant my father entered. I saw
            unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me
            cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
            some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, Papa!
            Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”</p>
          <p>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather have been for
            ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so
            highly.”</p>
          <p>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”</p>
          <p>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried to-day, and
            I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”<anchor id="struct139b"/></p>

          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_169" n="157"/>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in
            my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I
            had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong
            enough to convict her; and, in this assurance, I calmed myself, expecting the trial with
            eagerness, but without prognosticating an evil result.</p>

          <p><app id="var1535"><lem>W<hi rend="smallcaps">E</hi> passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock, when the
            trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as
            witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of
            justice, I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether the result of my
            curiosity and lawless devices would cause the</lem></app> death of two of my <app id="var1536"><lem>fellow-beings: one</lem></app> a
            smiling <app id="var1537"><lem>babe,</lem></app> full of innocence and <app id="var1538"><lem>joy;</lem></app> the other far more dreadfully <app id="var1539"><lem>murdered,</lem></app> with
            every <app id="var1540"><lem>aggravation of</lem></app> in<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_173" n="161"/>famy that could make <app id="var1541"><lem>the</lem></app>
            murder <app id="var1542"><lem>memorable</lem></app> in horror. Justine also was a girl of <app id="var1543"><lem>merit,</lem></app> and possessed qualities
            which promised to render her <app id="var1544"><lem>life happy:</lem></app> now all was to be <app id="var1545"><lem>obliterated</lem></app> in <app id="var1546"><lem>an</lem></app> ignominious
            <app id="var1547"><lem>grave;</lem></app> <app id="var1548"><lem>and</lem></app> I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of
            the crime ascribed to <app id="var1549"><lem>Justine;</lem></app> but I was absent when it was <app id="var1550"><lem>committed,</lem></app> and such a
            declaration would <app id="var1551"><lem>have been</lem></app> considered as the ravings of a <app id="var1552"><lem>madman,</lem></app> and <app id="var1553"><lem>would</lem></app> not have
            <app id="var1554"><lem>exculpated</lem></app> her who suffered through <app id="var1555"><lem>me.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct146a"/>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
            always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
            Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and
            execrated by thousands; for all the <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_174" n="162"/>kindness which
            her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators
            by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil,
            yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been
            adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
            When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we
            were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered
            herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.<anchor id="struct146b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct147a"/> <anchor id="struct147b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1556"><lem>The</lem></app> trial <app id="var1557"><lem>began;</lem></app> and after the advocate against her had stated the <app id="var1558"><lem>charge,</lem></app> several
            witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against <app id="var1559"><lem>her,</lem></app> which <app id="var1560"><lem>might</lem></app> have
            staggered any one <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_175" n="163"/>who had not such <app id="var1561"><lem>proof</lem></app> of her
            innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the <app id="var1562"><lem>murder</lem></app> had been
            <app id="var1563"><lem>committed,</lem></app> and towards morning had been perceived by a <app id="var1564"><lem>market-woman</lem></app> not far from the
            spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. <app id="var1565"><lem>The</lem></app> woman asked <app id="var1566"><lem>her</lem></app>
            what she did <app id="var1567"><lem>there;</lem></app> but she looked very <app id="var1568"><lem>strangely,</lem></app> and only returned a confused <app id="var1569"><lem>and
            unintelligible answer. She</lem></app> returned to the house about eight <app id="var1570"><lem>o’clock;</lem></app> and when <app id="var1571"><lem>one
            inquired</lem></app> where she had passed the <app id="var1572"><lem>night,</lem></app> she <app id="var1573"><lem>replied,</lem></app> that she had been looking <app id="var1574"><lem>for</lem></app> the
            <app id="var1575"><lem>child,</lem></app> and <app id="var1576"><lem>demanded earnestly,</lem></app> if any thing had been heard <app id="var1577"><lem>concerning</lem></app> him. When <app id="var1578"><lem>shewn
            the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days. The
            picture</lem></app> was <app id="var1579"><lem>then produced, which the servant had found in her pocket; and when
            Elizabeth, in <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_176" n="164"/>a faltering voice, proved that it
            was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his
            neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct148a"/>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had
            altered. Surprise, horror, and misery, were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled
            with her tears; but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke
            in an audible although variable voice:—<anchor id="struct148b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct149a"/> <anchor id="struct149b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1580"><lem>“God</lem></app> knows,” she said, <app id="var1581"><lem>“how</lem></app> entirely I am <app id="var1582"><lem>innocent. But</lem></app> I do not pretend <app id="var1583"><lem>that</lem></app> my
            protestations <app id="var1584"><lem>should acquit me: I</lem></app> rest my innocence <app id="var1585"><lem>on</lem></app> a <app id="var1586"><lem>plain and simple</lem></app> explanation of
            the <app id="var1587"><lem>facts</lem></app> which have been adduced against <app id="var1588"><lem>me;</lem></app> and I hope the character I have always
            borne will <app id="var1589"><lem>incline</lem></app> my judges to a favourable <app id="var1590"><lem>interpretation,</lem></app> where <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_177" n="165"/>any <app id="var1591"><lem>circumstance appears doubtful or
            suspicious.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct150a"/> <anchor id="struct150b"/></p>
          <p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of
            the night on which the murder had been committed, at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a
            village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock,
            she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She
            was alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates
            of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn
            belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
            known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her asylum early, that she might again
            endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_178" n="166"/>where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been
            bewildered when questioned by the market-woman, was not surprising, since she had passed
            a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the
            picture she could give no account.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct151a"/> <anchor id="struct151b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1592"><lem>“I know,” continued the</lem></app> unhappy <app id="var1593"><lem>victim,</lem></app> “how heavily and fatally this <app id="var1594"><lem>one</lem></app> circumstance
            <app id="var1595"><lem>weighs</lem></app> against <app id="var1596"><lem>me,</lem></app> but I have no power of explaining <app id="var1597"><lem>it;</lem></app> and when I have expressed my
            utter <app id="var1598"><lem>ignorance,</lem></app> I am only left <app id="var1599"><lem>to</lem></app> conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it
            might have been placed in my pocket. But <app id="var1600"><lem>here</lem></app> also I am <app id="var1601"><lem>checked.</lem></app> I believe that I have
            <app id="var1602"><lem>no</lem></app> enemy on <app id="var1603"><lem>earth,</lem></app> and none surely <app id="var1604"><lem>would</lem></app> have been so wicked as <app id="var1605"><lem>to</lem></app> destroy me <app id="var1606"><lem>wantonly.</lem></app>
            Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_179" n="167"/>for so <app id="var1607"><lem>doing;</lem></app> or if I <app id="var1608"><lem>had,</lem></app> why should he have stolen
            the <app id="var1609"><lem>jewel,</lem></app> to part with it <app id="var1610"><lem>again</lem></app> so <app id="var1611"><lem>soon?</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct152a"/>“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg
            permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character; and if their
            testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would
            pledge my salvation on my innocence.”</p>
          <p>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of
            her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them
            timorous, and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her
            excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when,
            although violently agi<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_180" n="168"/>tated, she desired
            permission to address the court.<anchor id="struct152b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct153a"/> <anchor id="struct153b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1612"><lem>“I am,”</lem></app> said <app id="var1613"><lem>she,</lem></app> “the cousin of the unhappy child who was <app id="var1614"><lem>murdered,</lem></app> or rather his
            <app id="var1615"><lem>sister,</lem></app> for I was educated <app id="var1616"><lem>by</lem></app> and <app id="var1617"><lem>have lived</lem></app> with his parents <app id="var1618"><lem>ever since</lem></app> and <app id="var1619"><lem>even long</lem></app>
            before his <app id="var1620"><lem>birth. It</lem></app> may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this
            <app id="var1621"><lem>occasion;</lem></app> but when I see a <app id="var1622"><lem>fellow-creature</lem></app> about to perish through the cowardice of her
            pretended <app id="var1623"><lem>friends,</lem></app> I wish to be allowed to <app id="var1624"><lem>speak,</lem></app> that I may say what I know of her
            character. <app id="var1625"><lem>I am</lem></app> well acquainted with <app id="var1626"><lem>the accused.</lem></app> I have lived in the same house with
            <app id="var1627"><lem>her,</lem></app> at one time for <app id="var1628"><lem>five,</lem></app> and <app id="var1629"><lem>at another</lem></app> for nearly two years. During all that <app id="var1630"><lem>period</lem></app>
            she appeared to me <app id="var1631"><lem>the</lem></app> most amiable and benevolent <app id="var1632"><lem>of human creatures.</lem></app> She <app id="var1633"><lem>nursed Madame
            Frankenstein,</lem></app> my <app id="var1634"><lem>aunt,</lem></app> in her last illness with the greatest affection and <app id="var1635"><lem>care;</lem></app> and <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_181" n="169"/><app id="var1636"><lem>afterwards</lem></app> attended her <app id="var1637"><lem>own</lem></app> mother during a <app id="var1638"><lem>tedious
            illness,</lem></app> in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her. After which she
            again lived in my <app id="var1639"><lem>uncle’s house,</lem></app> where she was <app id="var1640"><lem>beloved</lem></app> by all the <app id="var1641"><lem>family. She</lem></app> was <app id="var1642"><lem>warmly</lem></app>
            attached to <app id="var1643"><lem>the</lem></app> child who <app id="var1644"><lem>is now dead,</lem></app> and acted towards him <app id="var1645"><lem>like</lem></app> a most affectionate
            <app id="var1646"><lem>mother. For</lem></app> my own <app id="var1647"><lem>part,</lem></app> I do not hesitate to <app id="var1648"><lem>say, that, notwithstanding</lem></app> all the
            <app id="var1649"><lem>evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no
            temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she
            had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem
            and value her.”</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var1650"><lem>Excellent</lem></app> Elizabeth! A murmur of approbation <app id="var1651"><lem>was heard;</lem></app> but it was <app id="var1652"><lem>excited</lem></app> by her
            generous <app id="var1653"><lem>interference, and</lem></app> not in favour of poor <app id="var1654"><lem>Justine,</lem></app> on whom <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_182" n="170"/>the public <app id="var1655"><lem>indignation was</lem></app> turned with renewed
            violence, charging <app id="var1656"><lem>her with</lem></app> the blackest <app id="var1657"><lem>ingratitude.</lem></app> She herself wept as Elizabeth
            <app id="var1658"><lem>spoke,</lem></app> but she did not answer. My own agitation <app id="var1659"><lem>and</lem></app> anguish was extreme <app id="var1660"><lem>during</lem></app> the whole
            <app id="var1661"><lem>trial. I</lem></app> believed in her <app id="var1662"><lem>innocence;</lem></app> I knew it. Could the <app id="var1663"><lem>dæmon,</lem></app> who had (I did not for a
            minute doubt) murdered my brother, <app id="var1664"><lem>also</lem></app> in his hellish <app id="var1665"><lem>sport have</lem></app> betrayed the <app id="var1666"><lem>innocent</lem></app>
            to death and ignominy. I could not sustain the horror of my <app id="var1667"><lem>situation;</lem></app> and when I
            <app id="var1668"><lem>perceived</lem></app> that the <app id="var1669"><lem>popular voice,</lem></app> and the <app id="var1670"><lem>countenances</lem></app> of <app id="var1671"><lem>the judges, had already
            condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the
            accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse
            tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var1672"><lem>I</lem></app> passed a night of unmingled <app id="var1673"><lem>wretch<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_183" n="171"/>edness.</lem></app> In
            the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the
            fatal <app id="var1674"><lem>question;</lem></app> but I was <app id="var1675"><lem>known,</lem></app> and the officer guessed <app id="var1676"><lem>the</lem></app> cause of my <app id="var1677"><lem>visit. The</lem></app>
            ballots had been <app id="var1678"><lem>thrown;</lem></app> they were all <app id="var1679"><lem>black, and</lem></app> Justine was condemned.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct156a"/> <anchor id="struct156b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1680"><lem>I</lem></app> cannot <app id="var1681"><lem>pretend</lem></app> to describe what I then <app id="var1682"><lem>felt.</lem></app> I had <app id="var1683"><lem>before</lem></app> experienced sensations of
            <app id="var1684"><lem>horror;</lem></app> and I have endeavoured to bestow <app id="var1685"><lem>upon</lem></app> them adequate <app id="var1686"><lem>expressions,</lem></app> but <app id="var1687"><lem>words</lem></app>
            cannot convey <app id="var1688"><lem>an</lem></app> idea of the <app id="var1689"><lem>heart-sickening</lem></app> despair that I then <app id="var1690"><lem>endured.</lem></app> The person to
            whom I <app id="var1691"><lem>addressed</lem></app> myself <app id="var1692"><lem>added,</lem></app> that Justine had <app id="var1693"><lem>already</lem></app> confessed her guilt. “That
            <app id="var1694"><lem>evidence,”</lem></app> he <app id="var1695"><lem>observed,</lem></app> “was hardly required in so glaring a <app id="var1696"><lem>case,</lem></app> but I <app id="var1697"><lem>am</lem></app> glad of it;
            <app id="var1698"><lem>and, indeed,</lem></app> none of our judges like to condemn a <app id="var1699"><lem>criminal</lem></app> upon circumstantial <app id="var1700"><lem>evidence,</lem></app>
            be <app id="var1701"><lem>it</lem></app> ever so decisive.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct157a"/><pb xml:id="F1818_v1_184" n="172"/>When I returned home, Elizabeth eagerly demanded
            the result.</p>
          <p>“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather
            that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should escape. But she has
            confessed.”</p>
          <p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s
            innocence. “Alas!” said she, “how shall I ever again believe in human benevolence?
            Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of
            innocence only to betray; her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or ill-humour,
            and yet she has committed a murder.”<anchor id="struct157b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct158a"/> <anchor id="struct158b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1702"><lem>Soon</lem></app> after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish to see my cousin. My
            father wished her not to <app id="var1703"><lem>go;</lem></app> but <app id="var1704"><lem>said,</lem></app> that he left it to her own <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_185" n="173"/><app id="var1705"><lem>judgment</lem></app> and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said
            <app id="var1706"><lem>Elizabeth,</lem></app> “I will <app id="var1707"><lem>go,</lem></app> although she is <app id="var1708"><lem>guilty;</lem></app> and <app id="var1709"><lem>you, Victor,</lem></app> shall <app id="var1710"><lem>accompany me:</lem></app> I
            cannot go alone.” <app id="var1711"><lem>The</lem></app> idea of this visit was torture to <app id="var1712"><lem>me,</lem></app> yet I could not refuse.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct159a"/>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the
            further end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on
            seeing us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of
            Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Justine!” said she, “why did you rob me of my last consolation. I relied on your
            innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am
            now.”</p>
          <p>“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also <pb xml:id="F1818_v1_186" n="174"/>join with my enemies to crush me?” Her voice was
            suffocated with sobs.</p>
          <p>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not
            one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I
            heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be

          <p>N<hi rend="smallcaps">OTHING</hi> is more painful to the human mind, than, after the
            feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
            inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.
            Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a
            weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_006" n="002"/>nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil
            spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more,
            much more, (I persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness,
            and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for
            the moment when I should put them in practice, and make myself useful to my
            fellow-beings. Now all was blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which
            allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather
            promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me
            away to a hell of intense tortures, such as no language can describe.</p>
          <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_007" n="003"/>from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the
            face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only
            consolation—deep, dark, death-like solitude.<anchor id="struct173b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1835"><lem>My</lem></app> father observed with pain <app id="var1836"><lem>the</lem></app> alteration perceptible in my <app id="var1837"><lem>disposition and</lem></app> habits,
            <app id="var1838"><lem>and</lem></app> endeavoured to reason with me on the folly of giving way to <app id="var1839"><lem>immoderate</lem></app> grief. “Do
            you think, <app id="var1840"><lem>Victor,”</lem></app> said <app id="var1841"><lem>he, “that</lem></app> I do not suffer <app id="var1842"><lem>also? No</lem></app> one <app id="var1843"><lem>could love</lem></app> a child more
            than I <app id="var1844"><lem>loved</lem></app> your <app id="var1845"><lem>brother;”</lem></app> (tears came <app id="var1846"><lem>into</lem></app> his eyes as he <app id="var1847"><lem>spoke);</lem></app> “but is it not <app id="var1848"><lem>a</lem></app>
            duty <app id="var1849"><lem>to</lem></app> the <app id="var1850"><lem>survivors, that we should refrain from augmenting</lem></app> their unhappiness by an
            <app id="var1851"><lem>appearance</lem></app> of immoderate <app id="var1852"><lem>grief?</lem></app> It is also a duty owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow
            prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of <app id="var1853"><lem>daily usefulness,</lem></app> without
            which no man is fit <app id="var1854"><lem>for society.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct175a"/><pb xml:id="F1818_v2_008" n="004"/>This advice, although good, was totally
            inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief, and console my
            friends, if remorse had not mingled its bitterness with my other sensations. Now I could
            only answer my father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself from his
            view.<anchor id="struct175b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1855"><lem>About</lem></app> this time <app id="var1856"><lem>we</lem></app> retired to our house at Belrive. This <app id="var1857"><lem>change</lem></app> was <app id="var1858"><lem>particularly
            agreeable</lem></app> to <app id="var1859"><lem>me.</lem></app> The shutting of the gates <app id="var1860"><lem>regularly</lem></app> at ten <app id="var1861"><lem>o’clock,</lem></app> and the
            impossibility of <app id="var1862"><lem>remaining</lem></app> on the lake after that <app id="var1863"><lem>hour, had</lem></app> rendered our residence
            within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now <app id="var1864"><lem>free. Often,</lem></app> after the rest of
            the family had retired for the <app id="var1865"><lem>night,</lem></app> I took the <app id="var1866"><lem>boat,</lem></app> and passed <app id="var1867"><lem>many hours</lem></app> upon the
            <app id="var1868"><lem>water. Sometimes,</lem></app> with my sails <app id="var1869"><lem>set,</lem></app> I was carried by the <app id="var1870"><lem>wind;</lem></app> and <app id="var1871"><lem>sometimes,</lem></app> after
            <app id="var1872"><lem>rowing</lem></app> into the middle of the <app id="var1873"><lem>lake,</lem></app> I <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_009" n="005"/>left the
            boat to <app id="var1874"><lem>pursue</lem></app> its own <app id="var1875"><lem>course,</lem></app> and <app id="var1876"><lem>gave way</lem></app> to my own miserable reflections. I was often
            <app id="var1877"><lem>tempted,</lem></app> when all was <app id="var1878"><lem>at</lem></app> peace around <app id="var1879"><lem>me,</lem></app> and I the only unquiet thing that wandered
            restless in a <app id="var1880"><lem>scene so beautiful and heavenly, if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose
            harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say,
            I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my
            calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering
            Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought
            also of my father, and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave them
            exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct177a"/>At these moments I wept bitterly, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_010" n="006"/>and wished that
            peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But
            that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable
            evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate
            some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he would
            still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the
            recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved
            remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him,
            I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that
            life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice,
            my hatred and <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_011" n="007"/>revenge burst all bounds of
            moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I,
            when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might
            wreak the utmost extent of anger on his head, and avenge the deaths of William and
            Justine.<anchor id="struct177b"/></p>

            upon the accounts of vice and <app id="var1901"><lem>injustice,</lem></app> that I read in books or heard from <app id="var1902"><lem>others,</lem></app> as
            tales of ancient <app id="var1903"><lem>days,</lem></app> or imaginary <app id="var1904"><lem>evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar
            to reason than to the imagination;</lem></app> but now misery has come <app id="var1905"><lem>home,</lem></app> and men appear to me as
            monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly <app id="var1906"><lem>unjust. Every body</lem></app>

            For the sake of a few <app id="var1911"><lem>jewels,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_013" n="009"/>to have murdered the

            into the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he
            walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to

            been described to them as so wonderful <app id="var1960"><lem>and</lem></app> sublime. Accordingly we departed from Geneva
            on this tour about the middle of the month of <app id="var1961"><lem>August,</lem></app> nearly two months after the death
            of <app id="var1962"><lem>Justine.</lem></app></p>

            been a sorrow to be chased away by any fleeting circumstance, this excursion would
            certainly have had the effect intended by my father. As it was, I was somewhat

            <app id="var1968"><lem>During the</lem></app> first day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the
            mountains at a <app id="var1969"><lem>distance, towards</lem></app> which we gradually advanced. <app id="var1970"><lem>We</lem></app> perceived that the
            valley through which we wound, and which was formed by the <app id="var1971"><lem>river Arve,</lem></app> whose course we
            followed, closed <app id="var1972"><lem>in upon</lem></app> us by <app id="var1973"><lem>degrees;</lem></app> and when the sun had <app id="var1974"><lem>set,</lem></app> we <app id="var1975"><lem>beheld</lem></app> immense
            mountains <app id="var1976"><lem>and precipices</lem></app> overhanging us on <app id="var1977"><lem>every side, and</lem></app> heard the sound of <app id="var1978"><lem>the</lem></app> river
            raging <app id="var1979"><lem>among</lem></app> rocks, and the dashing of <app id="var1980"><lem>water-falls around.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct183a"/><pb xml:id="F1818_v2_017" n="013"/>The next day we pursued our journey upon mules;
            and as we ascended still higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing
            character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous
            Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees, formed a
            scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps,
            whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
            earth, the habitations of another race of beings.<anchor id="struct183b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct184a"/> <anchor id="struct184b"/></p>
          <p>We passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened
            before us, and we began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after we entered
            the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_018" n="014"/>and picturesque as that of Servox, through which
            we had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries; but we
            saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; we
            heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avelânche, and marked the smoke of its
            passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the
            surrounding <hi rend="italic">aiguilles</hi>, and its tremendous <hi rend="italic">dome</hi> overlooked the valley.</p>

          <p><app id="var1981"><lem>During this journey, I sometimes joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself to point out to
            her the various beauties of the scene. I often suffered my mule to lag behind, and
            indulged in the misery of reflection. At other times I spurred on</lem></app> the animal before my
            <app id="var1982"><lem>companions,</lem></app> that I might forget them, the world, <app id="var1983"><lem>and,</lem></app> more than <app id="var1984"><lem>all,</lem></app> myself. When at <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_019" n="015"/>a <app id="var1985"><lem>distance,</lem></app> I <app id="var1986"><lem>alighted,</lem></app> and threw myself on the
            <app id="var1987"><lem>grass,</lem></app> weighed down by horror <app id="var1988"><lem>and</lem></app> despair. At eight in the evening <app id="var1989"><lem>I</lem></app> arrived at
            <app id="var1990"><lem>Chamounix.</lem></app> My father <app id="var1991"><lem>and</lem></app> Elizabeth were very much <app id="var1992"><lem>fatigued; Ernest,</lem></app> who accompanied <app id="var1993"><lem>us,</lem></app>
            was <app id="var1994"><lem>delighted,</lem></app> and in high <app id="var1995"><lem>spirits: the</lem></app> only circumstance that detracted from his

          <p><anchor id="struct186a"/>We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not. I remained
            many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning that played above Mont Blanc,
            and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which ran below my window.</p>

            more cheerfulness than <app id="var2020"><lem>had</lem></app> been <app id="var2021"><lem>my</lem></app> custom for some time. My <app id="var2022"><lem>father</lem></app> was <app id="var2023"><lem>pleased,</lem></app> and

          <p><app id="var2029"><lem>The following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits
            of the mountains. I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy. The rain depressed me; my
            old feelings recurred, and I was miserable. I knew how disappointed my father would be
            at this sudden change, and I wished to avoid him until I had recovered myself so far as
            to be enabled to conceal those feelings that overpowered me. I knew that they would
            remain that day at the inn; <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_022" n="018"/>and as I had ever</lem></app>
            inured myself to <app id="var2030"><lem>rain, moisture,</lem></app> and <app id="var2031"><lem>cold,</lem></app> I resolved <app id="var2032"><lem>to</lem></app> go <app id="var2033"><lem>alone to</lem></app> the summit of
            <app id="var2034"><lem>Montanvert.</lem></app> I remembered the effect <app id="var2035"><lem>that the</lem></app> view of the tremendous and <app id="var2036"><lem>ever-moving</lem></app>
            glacier had <app id="var2037"><lem>produced</lem></app> upon my mind when I first saw <app id="var2038"><lem>it. It</lem></app> had then filled me with a
            sublime <app id="var2039"><lem>ecstacy</lem></app> that gave wings to the <app id="var2040"><lem>soul,</lem></app> and allowed <app id="var2041"><lem>it</lem></app> to soar from the <app id="var2042"><lem>obscure</lem></app>
            world to light <app id="var2043"><lem>and</lem></app> joy. The sight of the awful <app id="var2044"><lem>and</lem></app> majestic in nature had indeed always
            the effect of <app id="var2045"><lem>solemnizing my mind, and</lem></app> causing me to forget <app id="var2046"><lem>the</lem></app> passing cares of life. I
            determined to go <app id="var2047"><lem>alone,</lem></app> for I was well acquainted with the <app id="var2048"><lem>path,</lem></app> and the presence of

          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v2_025" n="021"/>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of
            the ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist
            covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the
            cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the
            waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The
            field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.
            The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood
            Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont
            Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful
            and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its
            dependent mountains, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_026" n="022"/>whose aërial summits hung
            over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.
            My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I
            exclaimed—“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds,
            allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of
            life.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct192a"/>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing
            towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I
            had walked with caution; his stature also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of
            man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I
            was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came
            nearer, (sight <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_027" n="023"/>tremendous and abhorred!) that it
            was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait
            his approach, and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance
            bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
            ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this;
            anger and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to
            overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.<anchor id="struct192b"/></p>

          <p> “I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> is with considerable difficulty that I remember the
            original æra of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
            A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at
            the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between
            the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed
            upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and
            troubled me; but <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_037" n="033"/> hardly had I felt this, when, by
            opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I
            believe, descended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before,
            dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now
            found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either
            surmount or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat
            wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the
            forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue,
            until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant
            state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the
            ground. I slaked my <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_038" n="034"/>thirst at the brook; and then
            lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct204a"/>“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened as it were
            instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a
            sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes; but these were insufficient
            to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew,
            and could distinguish, nothing; but, feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and
            wept.<anchor id="struct204b"/></p>

            would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of
            the fire which I had obtained through accident, and knew not how to <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_044" n="040"/>re-produce it. I gave several hours to the serious
            consideration of this difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
            it; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting
            sun. I passed three days in these rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A
            great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform
            white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp

            down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_052" n="048"/>to play, and to produce sounds, sweeter than the voice of the thrush or
            the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld
            aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager,
            won my reverence; while the gentle manners</lem></app> of the <app id="var2462"><lem>girl enticed my love. He played a
            sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion,
            of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few
            sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and
            smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and
            overpowering nature: they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never
            before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_053" n="049"/>withdrew from</lem></app> the <app id="var2463"><lem>window, unable to bear these
            emotions.</lem></app></p>

          <p>“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The
            girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and, taking some of the
            fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a
            nook of the cottage, and he shewed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed
            pleased, and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water,
            and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went
            into the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he
            had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him, and they entered the
            cottage together.</p>

            pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening, the young girl

            the old man again took up the instrument, which produced the divine sounds that had
            enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,

            <app id="var2660"><lem>believe,</lem></app> he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, <app id="var2661"><lem>because</lem></app> he often went <app id="var2662"><lem>forth,</lem></app> and
            did not return <app id="var2663"><lem>until</lem></app> dinner, yet brought no wood with <app id="var2664"><lem>him. At</lem></app> other times he worked in
            the <app id="var2665"><lem>garden; but,</lem></app> as there was <app id="var2666"><lem>little</lem></app> to do in the frosty <app id="var2667"><lem>season,</lem></app> he <app id="var2668"><lem>read</lem></app> to the old man
            and Agatha.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct232a"/>“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I discovered that he
            uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I conjectured,
            therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I
            ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible, when I did not even
            understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in
            this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_067" n="063"/>conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I
            easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I
            ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which
            knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with
            this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>
          <p>“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate
            complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At
            first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the
            mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I
            was filled with the bitterest sen<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_068" n="064"/>sations of
            despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of
            this miserable deformity.</p>
          <p>“As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld
            the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more employed; and the
            heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards
            found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several
            new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of
            comfort increased daily as the season advanced.</p>
          <p>“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I
            found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_069" n="065"/>This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and
            the season became far more pleasant than it had been.</p>
          <p>“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of
            the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the
            remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest,
            if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected
            my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I
            cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by
            Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly
            astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_070" n="066"/>occasions, utter the words <hi rend="italic">good spirit</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi>; but I did not then understand the signification of these
            terms.</p>
          <p>“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings
            of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable,
            and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore
            happiness to these deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the
            venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before me. I
            looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I
            formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their
            reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour
            and conciliating <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_071" n="067"/>words, I should first win their
            favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
          <p>“These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring
            the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was
            very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood
            with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass, whose
            intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment
            than blows and execration.</p>
          <p>“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the
            earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves, dispersed
            themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more
              cheer<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_072" n="068"/>ful notes, and the leaves began to bud
            forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time
            before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting
            appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and
            the future gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
          <p> “I <hi rend="smallcaps">NOW</hi> hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall
            relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I was, have made me what
            I am.</p>
          <p>“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies cloudless. It
            surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most
            beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand
            scents of delight, and a thousand sights of beauty.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v2_074" n="070"/>“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers
            periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children
            listened to him—I observed that the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond
            expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music, and I
            conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied
            in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when some one tapped at
            the door.</p>
          <p>“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was
            dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to
            which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.
            Her voice was musical, but unlike that of <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_075" n="071"/>either
            of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she
            saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.
            Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but
            gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion
            wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</p>
          <p>“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished
            from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could
            hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure;
            and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by
            different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_076" n="072"/>she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her,
            as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him,
            but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and, dismissing her guide, conducted her into
            the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young
            stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her,
            and embraced her affectionately.</p>
          <p>“I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared
            to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, or herself understood, the
            cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her presence
            diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
            morning mists. Felix seemed <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_077" n="073"/>peculiarly happy, and
            with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the
            hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to
            me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while
            they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.
            Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of one sound which the stranger repeated
            after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly
            occurred to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The
            stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them indeed were those
            which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>
          <p>“As night came on, Agatha and the <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_078" n="074"/>Arabian retired
            early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good
            night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the
            frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject
            of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty
            towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
          <p>“The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of
            Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his
            guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of
            sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence,
            swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v2_079" n="075"/>“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to
            Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it
            in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared
            enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by
            which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by
            her music.</p>
          <p>“The days now passed as peacefully as before, with the sole alteration that joy had
            taken the place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and
            happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I
            began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>
          <p>“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_080" n="076"/>the green banks interspersed with innumerable
            flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight
            woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were
            an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting
            and early rising of the sun; for I never ventured abroad during day-light, fearful of
            meeting with the same treatment as I had formerly endured in the first village which I
            entered.</p>
          <p>“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language;
            and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very
            little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost
            every word that was spoken.</p>
          <p>“While I improved in speech, I also <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_081" n="077"/>learned the
            science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide
            field for wonder and delight.</p>
          <p>“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s <hi rend="italic">Ruins of
              Empires</hi>. I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in
            reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because
            the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work
            I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the several empires at present
            existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and
            religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of
            the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful
            virtue of the early Romans—<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_082" n="078"/>of their subsequent
            degeneration—of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.
            I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the
            hapless fate of its original inhabitants.</p>
          <p>“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once
            so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one
            time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at another as all that can be conceived of
            noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can
            befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared
            the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless
            worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_083" n="079"/>forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were
            laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased,
            and I turned away with disgust and loathing.</p>
          <p>“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to
            the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human
            society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and
            squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>
          <p>“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most
            esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and unsullied descent united with riches. A
            man might be respected with only one of these acquisitions; but without either he was
            considered, except in very rare instances, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_084" n="080"/>as a
            vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profit of the chosen few. And
            what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I
            possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endowed with a
            figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was
            more agile than they, and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat
            and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded their’s. When I looked
            around, I saw and heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth,
            from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?</p>
          <p>“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried
            to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_085" n="081"/>I had forever remained in my native wood, nor known
            or felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!</p>
          <p>“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized
            on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and
            feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain,
            and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and
            good feelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I
            was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by
            stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the
            desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha, <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_086" n="082"/>and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian,
            were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of
            the loved Felix, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>
          <p>“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the difference of
            sexes; of the birth and growth of children; how the father doated on the smiles of the
            infant, and the lively sallies of the older child; how all the life and cares of the
            mother were wrapt up in the precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained
            knowledge; of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human
            being to another in mutual bonds.</p>
          <p>“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no
            mother had blessed me <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_087" n="083"/>with smiles and caresses; or
            if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished
            nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.
            I had never yet seen a being resembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What
            was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.</p>
          <p>“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to return to the
            cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and
            wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for
            so I loved, in an innocent, half painful self-deceit, to call them).</p>

            thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her
            father’s, who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his

            months’ rent, and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair

            life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_130" n="126"/>dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will
            never recover their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take
            possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this place.’</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct288a"/>“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in
            which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family
            of De Lacey more.</p>
          <p>“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid
            despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only link that held me to the
            world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did
            not strive to controul them; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent
            my mind towards injury and <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_131" n="127"/>death. When I thought
            of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the
            exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat
            soothed me. But again, when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger
            returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any thing human, I turned my fury
            towards inanimate objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around
            the cottage; and, after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I
            waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.<anchor id="struct288b"/></p>

            I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful
            of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun
            became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_135" n="131"/>frozen; the surface of the earth was hard, and
            chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on
            the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned
            to gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did
            I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were
            hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a
            map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings
            allowed me no respite: no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not
            extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of
            Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_136" n="132"/>green, confirmed in an especial manner the

            was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches,
            now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to
            pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the
            shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot
            where I was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued her
            course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she
            fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding place, and, with extreme labour from
            the force of the current, saved her, and dragged her <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_138" n="134"/>to shore. She was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my
            power, to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a
            rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he
            darted towards me, and, tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts
            of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near,
            he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my

            to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever. At length I
            wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses,
            consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you
            have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone, and miserable; man will not

          <p>“You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those

          <p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_147" n="143"/>died away while he narrated his peaceful life among

          <p><anchor id="struct307a"/>“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and, instead of threatening, I am content

            all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and
            tell me why I should pity man <pb xml:id="F1818_v2_148" n="144"/>more than he pities
            me? You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those
            ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man, when
            he contemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and, instead of
            injury, I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
            But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine
            shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot
            inspire love, I will cause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my

            I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale, and the feelings he now

          <p><anchor id="struct313a"/>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes felt a wish
            to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and
            talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I
            tried to stifle these sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathize with him, I

          <p><anchor id="struct315a"/>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various argu<pb xml:id="F1818_v2_155" n="151"/>ments which he had employed. I thought of the
            promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the
            subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors
            had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a
            creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit
            among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would
            be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I concluded, that the justice
            due both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his
            request. Turning to him, therefore, I said—</p>
          <p>“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other

            vengeance of the disappointed <app id="var3553"><lem>fiend,</lem></app> yet I <app id="var3554"><lem>was unable to overcome my repugnance to the
            task which was enjoined me. I found that I could</lem></app> not <app id="var3555"><lem>compose a female without again
            devoting several months to profound study and labo<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_006" n="002"/>rious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English
            philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought
            of obtaining</lem></app> my <app id="var3556"><lem>father’s consent</lem></app> to <app id="var3557"><lem>visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every
            pretence of delay, and could not resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity.</lem></app> My
            <app id="var3558"><lem>health,</lem></app> which had hitherto <app id="var3559"><lem>declined,</lem></app> was now much <app id="var3560"><lem>restored; and</lem></app> my <app id="var3561"><lem>spirits,</lem></app> when
            unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose <app id="var3562"><lem>proportionably.</lem></app> My father saw this
            <app id="var3563"><lem>change with pleasure,</lem></app> and he turned his thoughts towards the best <app id="var3564"><lem>method</lem></app> of eradicating
            the remains of my <app id="var3565"><lem>melancholy,</lem></app> which every now and then would return by <app id="var3566"><lem>fits, and</lem></app> with a
            devouring blackness <app id="var3567"><lem>overcast</lem></app> the approaching <app id="var3568"><lem>sunshine.</lem></app> At these moments I took refuge in
            the most perfect <app id="var3569"><lem>solitude.</lem></app> I passed whole <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_007" n="003"/>days on
            the lake <app id="var3570"><lem>alone in a little boat, watching</lem></app> the <app id="var3571"><lem>clouds, and</lem></app> listening to the <app id="var3572"><lem>rippling</lem></app> of
            the waves, silent <app id="var3573"><lem>and</lem></app> listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to
            restore me to some degree of <app id="var3574"><lem>composure; and,</lem></app> on my <app id="var3575"><lem>return,</lem></app> I met the <app id="var3576"><lem>salutations</lem></app> of my
            friends with a readier <app id="var3577"><lem>smile and</lem></app> a more cheerful <app id="var3578"><lem>heart.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct325a"/>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus
            addressed me:—</p>
          <p>“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and
            seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our
            society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday
            an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such
            a point would be not only <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_008" n="004"/>useless, but draw down
            treble misery on us all.”</p>

          <p><anchor id="struct331a"/>I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering
            any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to
            arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my cousin was
            one of horror and dismay. I was bound <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_011" n="007"/>by a solemn
            promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold
            miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival
            with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must
            perform my engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself
            to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected peace.<anchor id="struct331b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3620"><lem>I</lem></app> remembered also the necessity <app id="var3621"><lem>imposed upon me</lem></app> of either <app id="var3622"><lem>journeying</lem></app> to <app id="var3623"><lem>England,</lem></app> or
            entering into a long correspondence with <app id="var3624"><lem>those</lem></app> philosophers of that <app id="var3625"><lem>country,</lem></app> whose

            <app id="var3638"><lem>occupation,</lem></app> in absence from my <app id="var3639"><lem>family;</lem></app> during which <app id="var3640"><lem>period</lem></app> some event might happen which

          <p><anchor id="struct333a"/>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England;
            but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under the guise
            of wishing to travel and see the world before I sat down for life within the walls of my
            native town.</p>
          <p>I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced to comply; for a
            more indulgent and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_013" n="009"/>less dictatorial parent did not
            exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to Strasburgh, where
            Clerval would join me. Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland, and our
            principal stay would be in England. We should return by France; and it was agreed that
            the tour should occupy the space of two years.<anchor id="struct333b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3647"><lem>My</lem></app> father pleased himself with the <app id="var3648"><lem>reflection,</lem></app> that <app id="var3649"><lem>my union with</lem></app> Elizabeth <app id="var3650"><lem>should take
            place immediately</lem></app> on my return to Geneva. “These two years,” said he, “will pass
            <app id="var3651"><lem>swiftly,</lem></app> and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your <app id="var3652"><lem>happiness. And,

          <p><anchor id="struct335a"/>“I am content,” I replied, “with <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_014" n="010"/>your
            arrangement. By that time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we
            at present are.” I sighed; but my father kindly forbore to question me further
            concerning the cause of my dejection. He hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of
            travelling, would restore my tranquillity.<anchor id="struct335b"/></p>

            with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the
            existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, <app id="var3661"><lem>exasperated</lem></app> as he might be
            by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might <app id="var3662"><lem>go;</lem></app> and would he not
            <app id="var3663"><lem>accompany</lem></app> me to England? This <app id="var3664"><lem>imagination</lem></app> was dreadful in <app id="var3665"><lem>itself,</lem></app> but <app id="var3666"><lem>soothing, inasmuch</lem></app>
            as <app id="var3667"><lem>it</lem></app> supposed the safety of my <app id="var3668"><lem>friends.</lem></app> I was agonized <app id="var3669"><lem>with</lem></app> the idea of <app id="var3670"><lem>the</lem></app> pos<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_015" n="011"/>sibility that the reverse of this might happen. <app id="var3671"><lem>But</lem></app>
            through the whole period during which I was the slave of my <app id="var3672"><lem>creature,</lem></app> I allowed myself
            to be <app id="var3673"><lem>governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly

            order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me: for I resolved to
            fulfil my promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free man. Filled with dreary
            imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes; but my eyes were

            <app id="var3721"><lem>rapidly,</lem></app> and winds between <app id="var3722"><lem>hills,</lem></app> not <app id="var3723"><lem>high,</lem></app> but <app id="var3724"><lem>steep,</lem></app> and of beautiful forms. We saw

            <app id="var3728"><lem>and</lem></app> inaccessible. This part of the <app id="var3729"><lem>Rhine, indeed,</lem></app> presents a <app id="var3730"><lem>singularly</lem></app> variegated
            <app id="var3731"><lem>landscape.</lem></app> In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined <app id="var3732"><lem>castles</lem></app> overlooking tremendous
            <app id="var3733"><lem>precipices,</lem></app> with the dark Rhine rushing <app id="var3734"><lem>beneath; and,</lem></app> on the sudden turn of a
            <app id="var3735"><lem>promontory, flourishing vineyards,</lem></app> with <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_019" n="015"/>green
            sloping <app id="var3736"><lem>banks, and</lem></app> a meandering <app id="var3737"><lem>river, and populous towns, occupy the scene.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var3738"><lem>We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the labourers, as we
            glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated
            by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed
            on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been
            a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as
            if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and</lem></app> enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.
            “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own <app id="var3739"><lem>country;</lem></app> I have <app id="var3740"><lem>visited</lem></app> the

            are more majestic <app id="var3764"><lem>and strange;</lem></app> but there is a charm in the banks of this divine <app id="var3765"><lem>river,</lem></app>
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_021" n="017"/>that I never before saw equalled. Look at that

            <app id="var3768"><lem>amongst</lem></app> the foliage of those lovely <app id="var3769"><lem>trees; and now that group of labourers coming from
            among their vines; and that village half-hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely,
            the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than
            those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our

            human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external

          <p>L<hi rend="smallcaps">ONDON</hi> was our present point of rest; we determined to remain
            several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of
            the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a
            secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information
            necessary for the completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of
            introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural
            philosophers.<anchor id="struct344b"/></p>

            come over my <app id="var3793"><lem>existence, and</lem></app> I only visited these people for the sake of the information
            they might <app id="var3794"><lem>give</lem></app> me on the subject in which <app id="var3795"><lem>my interest</lem></app> was so <app id="var3796"><lem>terribly profound.</lem></app> Company

            But <app id="var3803"><lem>busy uninteresting</lem></app> joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an

            <app id="var3815"><lem>instruction and amusement.</lem></app> He was for ever <app id="var3816"><lem>busy; and</lem></app> the only check to his enjoyments

            life, undisturbed by any care or <app id="var3820"><lem>bitter</lem></app> recollection. I often refused to accompany <app id="var3821"><lem>him,
            alleging</lem></app> another <app id="var3822"><lem>engagement,</lem></app> that I might remain <app id="var3823"><lem>alone.</lem></app> I now also began to collect the
            materials necessary for my <app id="var3824"><lem>new creation, and</lem></app> this was <app id="var3825"><lem>to</lem></app> me like the torture of single
            drops of water continually falling on the <app id="var3826"><lem>head.</lem></app> Every thought that was devoted to it was
            <app id="var3827"><lem>an</lem></app> extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_028" n="024"/>caused my lips to <app id="var3828"><lem>quiver, and</lem></app> my heart to

          <p><anchor id="struct347a"/>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland,
            who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native
            country, and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong
            our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept
            this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and
            streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
            dwelling-places.<anchor id="struct347b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct348a"/> <anchor id="struct348b"/></p>
          <p>We had arrived in <app id="var3830"><lem>England</lem></app> at the beginning of <app id="var3831"><lem>October,</lem></app> and it was now <app id="var3832"><lem>February. We
            accordingly</lem></app> determined to commence our journey towards the north <app id="var3833"><lem>at</lem></app> the expiration of
            another month. In this expedition we did not <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_029" n="025"/>intend to follow the great road to <app id="var3834"><lem>Edinburgh, but</lem></app> to visit Windsor, Oxford, <app id="var3835"><lem>Matlock,
            and</lem></app> the Cumberland <app id="var3836"><lem>lakes,</lem></app> resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the
            end of July. I packed <app id="var3837"><lem>up my</lem></app> chemical <app id="var3838"><lem>instruments, and</lem></app> the materials <app id="var3839"><lem>I</lem></app> had <app id="var3840"><lem>collected,
            resolving</lem></app> to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the <app id="var3841"><lem>northern highlands</lem></app> of
            <app id="var3842"><lem>Scotland.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct349a"/>We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in
            its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the
            quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us.</p>
          <p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with
            the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a
            half <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_030" n="026"/>before. It was here that Charles I. had
            collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had
            forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory of that
            unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Gower, his
            queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be
            supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we
            delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary
            gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain
            our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
            magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite
            verdure, is spread forth into a <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_031" n="027"/>placid expanse of
            waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes,
            embosomed among aged trees.</p>
          <p>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the
            past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my
            youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of
            what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart,
            and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered
            my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to
            be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent to
            myself.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v3_032" n="028"/>We passed a considerable period at Oxford,
            rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate
            to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were
            often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb
            of the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my
            soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
            of liberty and self-sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the
            remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a
            free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling
            and hopeless, into my miserable self.<anchor id="struct349b"/></p>

            village resembled,</lem></app> to <app id="var3846"><lem>a greater degree,</lem></app> the scenery of Switzerland; <app id="var3847"><lem>but everything</lem></app> is on

            attend on the piny <app id="var3852"><lem>mountains</lem></app> of <app id="var3853"><lem>my native</lem></app> country. We visited the wondrous <app id="var3854"><lem>cave, and</lem></app> the
            little cabinets of natural <app id="var3855"><lem>history,</lem></app> where the curiosities are disposed in the same

            Westmoreland. I could now almost fancy myself among the <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_034" n="030"/>Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
            northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams, were
            all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost
            contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater
            than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own
            nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have
            possessed while he associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he
            to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the
            Rhine.”<anchor id="struct351b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3872"><lem>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and conceived
            an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our
            Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not
            sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the
            dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my
            relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every moment from which I might
            otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish im<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_036" n="032"/>patience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and</lem></app>
            overcome by a thousand fears; <app id="var3873"><lem>and</lem></app> when they <app id="var3874"><lem>arrived,</lem></app> and I saw the superscription of
            Elizabeth or my <app id="var3875"><lem>father,</lem></app> I hardly dared to read <app id="var3876"><lem>and ascertain</lem></app> my fate. Sometimes I
            thought that the fiend followed <app id="var3877"><lem>me, and</lem></app> might <app id="var3878"><lem>expedite</lem></app> my <app id="var3879"><lem>remissness by</lem></app> murdering my
            <app id="var3880"><lem>companion.</lem></app> When these thoughts <app id="var3881"><lem>possessed me,</lem></app> I would not quit Henry for a <app id="var3882"><lem>moment,</lem></app> but
            followed him as his <app id="var3883"><lem>shadow,</lem></app> to protect him from <app id="var3884"><lem>the</lem></app> fancied rage of his destroyer. I
            felt as if I had <app id="var3885"><lem>committed</lem></app> some great <app id="var3886"><lem>crime,</lem></app> the <app id="var3887"><lem>consciousness</lem></app> of which haunted me. I
            was <app id="var3888"><lem>guiltless,</lem></app> but I had <app id="var3889"><lem>indeed</lem></app> drawn down a horrible curse <app id="var3890"><lem>upon my head, as</lem></app> mortal as
            that of <app id="var3891"><lem>crime.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct355a"/>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested
            the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_037" n="033"/>as Oxford; for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
            But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle, and its
            environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the
            Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and
            admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.<anchor id="struct355b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct356a"/> <anchor id="struct356b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3892"><lem>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrews, and along the banks
            of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to laugh and

            from a <app id="var3893"><lem>guest;</lem></app> and accordingly I told <app id="var3894"><lem>Clerval</lem></app> that I wished to make the tour of Scotland
            <app id="var3895"><lem>alone.</lem></app> “Do <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_038" n="034"/>you,” said I, “enjoy <app id="var3896"><lem>yourself,</lem></app> and let

          <p><anchor id="struct357a"/>Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.
            He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary
            rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know: hasten then, my dear friend,
            to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your
            absence.”</p>
          <p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland, and
            finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_039" n="035"/>monster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should have
            finished, that he might receive his companion.<anchor id="struct357b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3907"><lem>With</lem></app> this resolution I traversed the northern <app id="var3908"><lem>highlands,</lem></app> and fixed on one of the

            work,</lem></app> being hardly more than a <app id="var3912"><lem>rock,</lem></app> whose high sides were continually beaten upon by
            the <app id="var3913"><lem>waves.</lem></app> The soil was <app id="var3914"><lem>barren, scarcely</lem></app> affording pasture for a few miserable <app id="var3915"><lem>cows, and
            oatmeal</lem></app> for its <app id="var3916"><lem>inhabitants,</lem></app> which <app id="var3917"><lem>consisted</lem></app> of five persons, <app id="var3918"><lem>whose</lem></app> gaunt <app id="var3919"><lem>and</lem></app> scraggy
            limbs gave tokens of their <app id="var3920"><lem>miserable</lem></app> fare. <app id="var3921"><lem>Vegetables and</lem></app> bread, when they indulged in
            such luxuries, <app id="var3922"><lem>and</lem></app> even fresh <app id="var3923"><lem>water,</lem></app> was to be procured from the main <app id="var3924"><lem>land,</lem></app> which was
            about five miles distant.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct359a"/>On the whole island there were but <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_040" n="036"/>three
            miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained
            but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The
            thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I
            ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession; an incident which
            would, doubtless, have occasioned some surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers
            been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested,
            hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering
            blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.<anchor id="struct359b"/></p>

            a <app id="var3932"><lem>monotonous,</lem></app> yet <app id="var3933"><lem>ever-changing</lem></app> scene. I thought of <app id="var3934"><lem>Switzerland; it</lem></app> was far different
            from this desolate <app id="var3935"><lem>and</lem></app> appalling <app id="var3936"><lem>landscape.</lem></app> Its hills are covered with <app id="var3937"><lem>vines, and</lem></app> its

          <p><anchor id="struct361a"/>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but, as I proceeded
            in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not
            prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days; and at other times I toiled
            day and night in order to complete my work. It was indeed a filthy process in which I
            was engaged. During <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_042" n="038"/>my first experiment, a kind of
            enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently
            fixed on the sequel of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.
            But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my

          <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">SAT</hi> one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the
            moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I
            remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the
            night, or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of
            reflection occurred to me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.
            Three years before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend whose
            unparalleled barbarity had desolated my <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_045" n="041"/>heart, and
            filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being, of
            whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more
            malignant than her mate, and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He
            had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had
            not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal,
            might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate
            each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not
            conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?
            She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit
            him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_046" n="042"/>provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.<anchor id="struct363b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct364a"/> <anchor id="struct364b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3961"><lem>Even if they were to leave Europe,</lem></app> and <app id="var3962"><lem>inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of</lem></app>
            the <app id="var3963"><lem>first results</lem></app> of <app id="var3964"><lem>those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would</lem></app> be <app id="var3965"><lem>children,
            and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth, who might make the very
            existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had</lem></app> I <app id="var3966"><lem>a
            right,</lem></app> for my own <app id="var3967"><lem>benefit,</lem></app> to inflict this curse <app id="var3968"><lem>upon</lem></app> everlasting generations? I had
            before been moved by the sophisms of the being <app id="var3969"><lem>I</lem></app> had created; I had been <app id="var3970"><lem>struck
            senseless</lem></app> by his fiendish <app id="var3971"><lem>threats: but now,</lem></app> for the first <app id="var3972"><lem>time,</lem></app> the wickedness <app id="var3973"><lem>of my
            promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their
            pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_047" n="043"/>the price perhaps of the existence of the whole
            human race.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct365a"/> <anchor id="struct365b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3974"><lem>I</lem></app> trembled, and my heart failed <app id="var3975"><lem>within me; when,</lem></app> on looking <app id="var3976"><lem>up,</lem></app> I <app id="var3977"><lem>saw,</lem></app> by the light of
            the moon, the dæmon <app id="var3978"><lem>at the casement.</lem></app> A ghastly grin <app id="var3979"><lem>wrinkled his lips</lem></app> as he gazed on <app id="var3980"><lem>me,</lem></app>
            where I <app id="var3981"><lem>sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.</lem></app> Yes, he had followed me in
            my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in <app id="var3982"><lem>caves,</lem></app> or taken refuge in wide
            <app id="var3983"><lem>and desert heaths; and</lem></app> he now came to <app id="var3984"><lem>mark</lem></app> my <app id="var3985"><lem>progress,</lem></app> <app id="var3986"><lem>and claim the fulfillment</lem></app> of <app id="var3987"><lem>my
            promise.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct366a"/>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and
            treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like
            him, and, trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The
            wretch saw me destroy the creature on <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_048" n="044"/>whose future
            existence he depended for happiness, and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge,
            withdrew.</p>
          <p>I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to
            resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was
            alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the sickening
            oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
          <p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost
            motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet
            moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze
            wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
            although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_049" n="045"/>until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore,
            and a person landed close to my house.<anchor id="struct366b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct367a"/> <anchor id="struct367b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3988"><lem>In</lem></app> a few minutes <app id="var3989"><lem>after,</lem></app> I heard the creaking of my <app id="var3990"><lem>door,</lem></app> as if some one endeavoured to
            open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it <app id="var3991"><lem>was,</lem></app> and
            wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from <app id="var3992"><lem>mine; but</lem></app> I was
            overcome by the <app id="var3993"><lem>sensation of helplessness,</lem></app> so often felt in <app id="var3994"><lem>frightful dreams,</lem></app> when you

          <p><anchor id="struct368a"/>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the
            wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me, and said, in a
            smothered voice—</p>
          <p>“You have destroyed the work <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_050" n="046"/>which you began;
            what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and
            misery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its
            willow islands, and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the
            heaths of England, and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable
            fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?”</p>
          <p>“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in
            deformity and wickedness.”</p>

            night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an

            one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from
            Clerval, entreating me to join him. He said that nearly a year had elapsed since we had
            quitted Switzerland, and France was yet unvisited. He en<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_057" n="053"/>treated me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle, and meet him at Perth,
            in a week from that time, when we might arrange the plan of our future proceedings. This

            my <app id="var4118"><lem>eyes, and</lem></app> that <app id="var4119"><lem>I,</lem></app> for the first <app id="var4120"><lem>time,</lem></app> saw clearly. <app id="var4121"><lem>The</lem></app> idea of renewing my labours

            I <app id="var4125"><lem>did not reflect</lem></app> that a voluntary act of mine <app id="var4126"><lem>could</lem></app> avert it. I had resolved in my own

          <p><anchor id="struct378a"/>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket
            aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was
            perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from
            them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with
            shuddering <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_060" n="056"/>anxiety any encounter with my
            fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly
            overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my
            basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away
            from the spot. The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the
            north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with such
            agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the
            rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
            moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut
            through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.<anchor id="struct378b"/></p>

            <app id="var4134"><lem>wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I
            found that the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the coast from
            which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found that if I
            again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my
            only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of
            terror. I had no compass with me, and was so little acquainted with the geography of
            this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into
            the wide Atlantic, and feel all the tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the
            immeasurable <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_062" n="058"/>waters that roared and buffeted
            around me. I</lem></app> had <app id="var4135"><lem>already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning thirst,</lem></app>
            a <app id="var4136"><lem>prelude</lem></app> to <app id="var4137"><lem>my other sufferings. I looked</lem></app> on the <app id="var4138"><lem>heavens, which were covered by clouds

            <app id="var4141"><lem>to</lem></app> be <app id="var4142"><lem>my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of
            Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; and sunk into a reverie, so despairing and
            frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever,

            might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that
            they spoke English; and I therefore addressed them in that language: “My good friends,”
            said I, “will you be so <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_065" n="061"/>kind as to tell me the
            name of this town, and inform me where I am?”</p>
          <p>“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a gruff voice. “May be you are
            come to a place that will not prove much to your taste; but you will not be consulted as
            to your quarters, I promise you.”</p>
          <p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger; and I was
            also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.
            “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I replied: “surely it is not the custom of Englishmen
            to receive strangers so inhospitably.”</p>
          <p>“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be; but it is the
            custom of the Irish to hate villains.”<anchor id="struct383b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4177"><lem>While</lem></app> this strange dialogue <app id="var4178"><lem>continued,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_066" n="062"/>I

            no one <app id="var4186"><lem>replied.</lem></app> I then moved <app id="var4187"><lem>forward,</lem></app> and a <app id="var4188"><lem>murmuring sound arose</lem></app> from the <app id="var4189"><lem>crowd</lem></app> as they

            of <app id="var4196"><lem>yourself.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct385a"/>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free

          <p>“Ay, Sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate; and you are to give

          <p><app id="var4197"><lem>This</lem></app> answer startled <app id="var4198"><lem>me; but</lem></app> I presently <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_067" n="063"/>recovered myself.

          <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">WAS</hi> soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an
            old benevolent man, with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some
            degree of severity; and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as
            witnesses on this occasion.<anchor id="struct387b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct388a"/> <anchor id="struct388b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4214"><lem>About</lem></app> half a dozen men came <app id="var4215"><lem>forward;</lem></app> and one being selected by the <app id="var4216"><lem>magistrate,</lem></app> he
            <app id="var4217"><lem>deposed,</lem></app> that he had been out fishing the night before with his son <app id="var4218"><lem>and</lem></app> brother-in-law,
            Daniel Nugent, <app id="var4219"><lem>when,</lem></app> about <app id="var4220"><lem>ten o’clock,</lem></app> they observed <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_069" n="065"/>a strong northerly blast <app id="var4221"><lem>rising, and</lem></app> they accordingly put in for port. It
            was a very dark <app id="var4222"><lem>night,</lem></app> as the moon had not yet risen; <app id="var4223"><lem>they</lem></app> did not <app id="var4224"><lem>land</lem></app> at the <app id="var4225"><lem>harbour,</lem></app>
            but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He <app id="var4226"><lem>walked on first,</lem></app>
            carrying a part of the fishing <app id="var4227"><lem>tackle, and</lem></app> his companions followed him at some distance.
            As he was <app id="var4228"><lem>proceeding</lem></app> along the <app id="var4229"><lem>sands,</lem></app> he <app id="var4230"><lem>struck</lem></app> his foot against <app id="var4231"><lem>something, and</lem></app> fell all
            his length on the <app id="var4232"><lem>ground. His companions</lem></app> came up to assist <app id="var4233"><lem>him; and,</lem></app> by the light of
            their <app id="var4234"><lem>lantern,</lem></app> they <app id="var4235"><lem>found</lem></app> that he had fallen on the body of a <app id="var4236"><lem>man,</lem></app> who was to all
            appearance dead. Their first supposition <app id="var4237"><lem>was,</lem></app> that it was the corpse of <app id="var4238"><lem>some</lem></app> person who
            had been <app id="var4239"><lem>drowned, and was</lem></app> thrown on shore by the <app id="var4240"><lem>waves; but,</lem></app> upon <app id="var4241"><lem>examination,</lem></app> they
            found that the clothes were not <app id="var4242"><lem>wet, and</lem></app> even that <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_070" n="066"/>the body was not <app id="var4243"><lem>then</lem></app> cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman
            near the <app id="var4244"><lem>spot, and endeavoured,</lem></app> but in <app id="var4245"><lem>vain,</lem></app> to restore it to <app id="var4246"><lem>life. He appeared to be a
            handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been
            strangled; for there was no sign of any violence, except the black mark of fingers on
            his neck.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct389a"/>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but when the mark
            of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of my brother, and felt myself
            extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to
            lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and of course
            drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.</p>
          <p>The son confirmed his father’s ac<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_071" n="067"/>count: but when
            Daniel Nugent was called, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his
            companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
            and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which
            I had just landed.<anchor id="struct389b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct390a"/> <anchor id="struct390b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4247"><lem>A</lem></app> woman <app id="var4248"><lem>deposed,</lem></app> that she lived near the <app id="var4249"><lem>beach, and</lem></app> was standing at the door of her
            <app id="var4250"><lem>cottage,</lem></app> waiting for the return <app id="var4251"><lem>of the fishermen, about</lem></app> an hour before she heard of the
            <app id="var4252"><lem>discovery</lem></app> of the <app id="var4253"><lem>body, when</lem></app> she saw a <app id="var4254"><lem>boat,</lem></app> with only one <app id="var4255"><lem>man</lem></app> in <app id="var4256"><lem>it,</lem></app> push off from that
            part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards <app id="var4257"><lem>found.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct391a"/>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her
            house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed it; and Daniel went to the
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_072" n="068"/>town for an apothecary, but life was quite
            gone.</p>
          <p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed, that, with the
            strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had
            beaten about for many hours, and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from
            which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the
            body from another place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the shore,
            I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the
            place where I had deposited the corpse.<anchor id="struct391b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct392a"/> <anchor id="struct392b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4258"><lem>Mr. Kirwin,</lem></app> on hearing this <app id="var4259"><lem>evidence,</lem></app> desired that I should be taken into the room
            where the body lay for <app id="var4260"><lem>interment,</lem></app> that it might be observed <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_073" n="069"/>what effect the sight of it would <app id="var4261"><lem>produce</lem></app> upon me. This idea was probably
            suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited <app id="var4262"><lem>when</lem></app> the mode of the murder had been
            <app id="var4263"><lem>described.</lem></app> I was <app id="var4264"><lem>accordingly conducted,</lem></app> by the <app id="var4265"><lem>magistrate and</lem></app> several other <app id="var4266"><lem>persons,</lem></app> to
            the <app id="var4267"><lem>inn.</lem></app> I could not help being struck by the strange <app id="var4268"><lem>coincidences</lem></app> that had taken place
            during this eventful <app id="var4269"><lem>night; but,</lem></app> knowing that I had been <app id="var4270"><lem>conversing</lem></app> with several persons
            in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body <app id="var4271"><lem>had been found, I was
            perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct393a"/> <anchor id="struct393b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4272"><lem>I</lem></app> entered the room where the <app id="var4273"><lem>corpse lay, and</lem></app> was led up to the coffin. How can I
            <app id="var4274"><lem>describe</lem></app> my <app id="var4275"><lem>sensations on beholding it?</lem></app> I feel yet parched with <app id="var4276"><lem>horror,</lem></app> nor can I
            <app id="var4277"><lem>reflect</lem></app> on that terrible moment without shuddering <app id="var4278"><lem>and agony,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_074" n="070"/>that faintly reminds <app id="var4279"><lem>me of</lem></app> the anguish of <app id="var4280"><lem>recognition.</lem></app> The trial, the
            presence of the magistrate <app id="var4281"><lem>and witnesses,</lem></app> passed like a dream from my <app id="var4282"><lem>memory,</lem></app> when I saw
            the lifeless form of Henry <app id="var4283"><lem>Clerval</lem></app> stretched before <app id="var4284"><lem>me.</lem></app> I gasped for <app id="var4285"><lem>breath; and,</lem></app>
            throwing myself on the <app id="var4286"><lem>body,</lem></app> I <app id="var4287"><lem>exclaimed, “Have</lem></app> my murderous <app id="var4288"><lem>machinations</lem></app> deprived you
            <app id="var4289"><lem>also,</lem></app> my dearest <app id="var4290"><lem>Henry,</lem></app> of <app id="var4291"><lem>life?</lem></app> Two <app id="var4292"><lem>I</lem></app> have already destroyed; other victims await their

          <p><anchor id="struct394a"/>The human frame could no longer support the agonizing suffering that I endured, and I
            was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>
          <p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death: my ravings, as I
            afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_075" n="071"/>of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
            attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and, at
            others, I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud
            with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone
            understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other
            witnesses.</p>
          <p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into
            forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of
            their doating parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the
            bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of
            what materials was <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_076" n="072"/>I made, that I could thus
            resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the
            torture.<anchor id="struct394b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct395a"/> <anchor id="struct395b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4298"><lem>But</lem></app> I was doomed to <app id="var4299"><lem>live; and,</lem></app> in two <app id="var4300"><lem>months,</lem></app> found myself <app id="var4301"><lem>as</lem></app> awaking from a dream, in
            a prison, stretched on a wretched <app id="var4302"><lem>bed,</lem></app> surrounded by <app id="var4303"><lem>gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and</lem></app> all
            the miserable apparatus of a <app id="var4304"><lem>dungeon.</lem></app> It was <app id="var4305"><lem>morning,</lem></app> I <app id="var4306"><lem>remember,</lem></app> when I thus awoke <app id="var4307"><lem>to
            understanding: I</lem></app> had forgotten <app id="var4308"><lem>the</lem></app> particulars of what had <app id="var4309"><lem>happened, and</lem></app> only felt as if
            some great <app id="var4310"><lem>misfortune</lem></app> had <app id="var4311"><lem>suddenly overwhelmed me; but</lem></app> when I looked <app id="var4312"><lem>around,</lem></app> and saw the
            barred windows, <app id="var4313"><lem>and</lem></app> the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my
            <app id="var4314"><lem>memory, and</lem></app> I groaned <app id="var4315"><lem>bitterly.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct396a"/>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_077" n="073"/>She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the
            turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise
            that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to
            see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire
            indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had
            heard during my sufferings:</p>
          <p>“Are you better now, Sir?” said she.</p>
          <p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all
            true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery
            and horror.”<anchor id="struct396b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct397a"/> <anchor id="struct397b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4316"><lem>“For</lem></app> that matter,” replied the old <app id="var4317"><lem>woman,</lem></app> “if you mean about the gentleman <app id="var4318"><lem>you
            murdered,</lem></app> I believe that it were better for you if you were <app id="var4319"><lem>dead,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_078" n="074"/>for I fancy it will go hard with <app id="var4320"><lem>you;</lem></app> but you will

            every body did the <app id="var4330"><lem>same.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct398a"/>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person
            just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid, and unable to reflect on all
            that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes
            doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the
            force of reality.</p>
          <p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness
            pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no
            dear hand sup<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_079" n="075"/>ported me. The physician came and
            prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was
            visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage
            of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who
            would gain his fee?<anchor id="struct398b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4348"><lem>One day, when I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open,
            and</lem></app> my cheeks livid like those <app id="var4349"><lem>in death,</lem></app> I was overcome by gloom <app id="var4350"><lem>and misery,</lem></app> and often
            reflected <app id="var4351"><lem>I</lem></app> had better <app id="var4352"><lem>seek</lem></app> death <app id="var4353"><lem>than remain</lem></app> miserably pent up only to be let loose in

            myself <app id="var4356"><lem>guilty, and</lem></app> suffer the penalty of the <app id="var4357"><lem>law, less innocent than poor Justine had

            entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and <app id="var4360"><lem>compassion;</lem></app> he drew a chair close to
            <app id="var4361"><lem>mine, and</lem></app> addressed me in <app id="var4362"><lem>French—</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct401a"/>“I fear that this place is very shock<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_081" n="077"/>ing to you;
            can I do any thing to make you more comfortable?”</p>
          <p>“I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole earth there is no
            comfort which I am capable of receiving.”</p>
          <p>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down
            as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy
            abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal
            charge.”</p>
          <p>“That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become the most
            miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any
            evil to me?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that
            have lately occur<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_082" n="078"/>red. You were thrown, by some
            surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality: seized immediately,
            and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of
            your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner, and placed, as it were, by some
            fiend across your path.”</p>
          <p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of
            my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess
            concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr.

            death of <app id="var4382"><lem>Clerval,</lem></app> as <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_084" n="080"/>a new incitement <app id="var4383"><lem>for me to

          <p><anchor id="struct405a"/>“Oh! take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not let him enter!”</p>
          <p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my
            exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in rather a severe tone—<anchor id="struct405b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct408a"/>“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to
            pleasure. “Is my father, indeed, come? How kind, how very kind. But where is he, why
            does he not hasten to me?”</p>
          <p>My change of manner surprised and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_085" n="081"/>pleased the
            magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of
            delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose, and quitted the
            room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.</p>
          <p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my

          <p><app id="var4388"><lem>My</lem></app> father calmed me <app id="var4389"><lem>with assurances of their welfare, and endeavoured, by dwelling on

          <p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my
            health rendered every precaution necessary that could insure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin
            came in, and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But
            the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually

          <p><anchor id="struct412a"/>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison; and
            although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel
            nearly a hundred miles to the county-town, where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged
            himself with every care of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared
            the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the
            court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being
            proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found, and
            a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.<anchor id="struct412b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct414a"/>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_090" n="086"/>Geneva, which I should soon visit—of Elizabeth, and
            Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish
            for happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved cousin; or longed,
            with a devouring <hi rend="italic">maladie du pays</hi>, to see once more the blue lake
            and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood: but my general state of
            feeling was a torpor, in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene
            in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted, but by paroxysms of anguish and
            despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed;
            and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some
            dreadful act of violence.<anchor id="struct414b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct416a"/>My father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having taken leave of Mr. Kirwin, we
            hastened to Dublin. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy weight, when the packet
            sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted for ever the country which had
            been to me the scene of so much misery.</p>
          <p>It was midnight. My father slept in <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_092" n="088"/>the cabin;
            and I lay on the deck, looking at the stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves.
            I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish
            joy, when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the
            light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from
            the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
            that I was deceived by no vision, and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had
            fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole
            life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my
            mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered shuddering at the mad enthusiasm
            that hurried me on to the crea<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_093" n="089"/>tion of my hideous
            enemy, and I called to mind the night during which he first lived. I was unable to
            pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept
            bitterly.<anchor id="struct416b"/></p>

            because I dreaded to see again those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments of
            <app id="var4502"><lem>tranquillity</lem></app> with my beloved <app id="var4503"><lem>Clerval.</lem></app> <app id="var4504"><lem>I</lem></app> thought with horror of seeing <app id="var4505"><lem>again those

            concerning an <app id="var4509"><lem>event,</lem></app> the very remembrance of which <app id="var4510"><lem>made</lem></app> me again feel <app id="var4511"><lem>the pang</lem></app> I endured
              <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_096" n="092"/> when I gazed on his lifeless <app id="var4512"><lem>form in</lem></app> the <app id="var4513"><lem>inn

          <p><anchor id="struct420a"/>As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again seeing me
            restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness and attentions were unremitting; my
            grief and gloom was obstinate, but he would not despair. Sometimes he thought that I
            felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he
            endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.</p>
          <p>“Alas! my father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and
            passions, would indeed be degraded, if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor
            unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for
            it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_097" n="093"/> and Henry—they all died by my hands.”<anchor id="struct420b"/></p>

            <app id="var4518"><lem>thus accused</lem></app> myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an <app id="var4519"><lem>explanation, and</lem></app> at others he
            appeared to consider it as caused by <app id="var4520"><lem>delirium, and that,</lem></app> during my <app id="var4521"><lem>illness,</lem></app> some idea of

            concerning the wretch I had created. I had a feeling that I should be supposed <app id="var4526"><lem>mad,</lem></app> and

          <p><anchor id="struct424a"/>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “What do you
            mean, Victor? <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_098" n="094"/>are you mad? My dear son, I entreat
            you never to make such an assertion again.”</p>
          <p>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
            operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent
            victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood,
            drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
            sacrifice the whole human race.”</p>
          <p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he
            instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and endeavoured to alter the course
            of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes
            that had taken place in Ireland, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_099" n="095"/>and never alluded
            to them, or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.<anchor id="struct424b"/></p>

            longer talked in the same incoherent manner <app id="var4532"><lem>of</lem></app> my own crimes; <app id="var4533"><lem>sufficient</lem></app> for me was the
            consciousness of them. By the utmost <app id="var4534"><lem>self-violence,</lem></app> I curbed the imperious voice of
            <app id="var4535"><lem>wretchedness,</lem></app> which <app id="var4536"><lem>sometimes desired</lem></app> to declare itself to the whole <app id="var4537"><lem>world; and</lem></app> my
            manners were calmer <app id="var4538"><lem>and</lem></app> more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the

            father had some business which detained us a few weeks. In this city, I received the

          <p>“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my <app id="var4541"><lem>uncle</lem></app> dated at <app id="var4542"><lem>Paris; you</lem></app>
            are no longer at a <app id="var4543"><lem>formidable distance,</lem></app> and I may hope to see you in less than a

            disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation
            that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary
            before we meet.</p>
          <p>“Explanation! you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really
            say this, my questions are answered, and I have no more to do than to sign myself your

            and yet be pleased with this explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case,
            I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to

            stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical dreams of love and joy; but the
            apple was already eaten, and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I

            indeed <app id="var4632"><lem>arrive</lem></app> a few months <app id="var4633"><lem>sooner; but</lem></app> if <app id="var4634"><lem>my torturer should suspect</lem></app> that I <app id="var4635"><lem>postponed

            <app id="var4641"><lem>blood,</lem></app> he had <app id="var4642"><lem>murdered Clerval</lem></app> immediately after the enunciation of <app id="var4643"><lem>his threats.</lem></app> <app id="var4644"><lem>I

            it a single hour.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct433a"/>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I
            fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that
            I may one day enjoy is concentered in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I
            consecrate my life, and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
            dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far
            from being <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_108" n="104"/>surprised at my misery, you will only
            wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror
            to you the day after our marriage shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be
            perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude
            to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”</p>
          <p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to Geneva. My
            cousin welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes, as she beheld my
            emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner, and
            had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness,
            and soft looks of compassion, made her a more fit companion for one blasted and
            miserable as I was.<anchor id="struct433b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct435a"/>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe
            me when transported by passion, and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
            She wept with me, and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour
            to inspire me with resignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but
            for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_110" n="106"/>otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of
            grief.</p>
          <p>Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with my cousin. I
            remained silent.</p>
          <p>“Have you, then, some other attachment?”</p>
          <p>“None on earth. I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with delight. Let the
            day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the

          <p><app id="var4679"><lem>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned:

            were balanced with <app id="var4689"><lem>it;</lem></app> and I <app id="var4690"><lem>therefore,</lem></app> with <app id="var4691"><lem>a contented and</lem></app> even cheerful <app id="var4692"><lem>countenance,</lem></app>
            agreed with my <app id="var4693"><lem>father,</lem></app> that <app id="var4694"><lem>if</lem></app> my cousin would <app id="var4695"><lem>consent, the ceremony should take place</lem></app>
            in ten <app id="var4696"><lem>days,</lem></app> and thus put, as I <app id="var4697"><lem>imagined,</lem></app> the seal to my fate.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct438a"/>Great God! if for one instant I <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_112" n="108"/>had thought what
            might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished
            myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over the
            earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic
            powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I
            prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.</p>
          <p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic
            feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of
            hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly
            deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union
            with placid contentment, not <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_113" n="109"/>unmingled with a
            little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and

            and everlasting regret.<anchor id="struct438b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4698"><lem>Preparations</lem></app> were made for the <app id="var4699"><lem>event; congratulatory</lem></app> visits <app id="var4700"><lem>were received;</lem></app> and all wore

            preyed <app id="var4703"><lem>there,</lem></app> and entered with seeming <app id="var4704"><lem>earnestness</lem></app> into the plans of my <app id="var4705"><lem>father,</lem></app> although
            they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. A house was purchased for us
            near <app id="var4706"><lem>Cologny,</lem></app> by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the <app id="var4707"><lem>country,</lem></app> and yet be so near

            benefit of Ernest, that he might follow his studies at the <app id="var4710"><lem>schools.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct440a"/><pb xml:id="F1818_v3_114" n="110"/>In the mean time I took every precaution to
            defend my person, in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a
            dagger constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by these
            means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the
            threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace,
            while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty,
            as the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of
            as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But
            on the day that was to fulfill my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_115" n="111"/>a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps
            also she thought of the dreadful secret, which I had promised to reveal to her on the
            following day. My father was in the mean time overjoyed; and, in the bustle of
            preparation, only observed in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.</p>
          <p>After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my father’s; but it was
            agreed that Elizabeth and I should pass the afternoon and night at Evian, and return to
            Cologny the next morning. As the day was fair, and the wind favourable, we resolved to
            go by water.<anchor id="struct440b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4711"><lem>Those</lem></app> were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.

            ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the
            invader who should wish to enslave it.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct442a"/>I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! if you knew what I have
            suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet, and
            freedom from despair, that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.”<anchor id="struct442b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct444a"/>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon
            melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her
            eyes, but it <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_118" n="114"/>continually gave place to distraction
            and reverie.</p>
          <p>The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and observed its path
            through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come
            closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its
            eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the

          <p><anchor id="struct448a"/>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a
            thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped
            a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I
            would sell my life dearly, and not relax the impending conflict until my own life, or
            that of my adversary, were extinguished.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence; at length
            she said, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?”</p>
          <p>“Oh! peace, peace, my love,” re<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_122" n="118"/>plied I, “this

          <p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how dreadful the

            ceased to issue from her <app id="var4829"><lem>lips.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct452a"/>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows
            of the room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale
            yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and,
            with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the
            most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as
            with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the
            window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he eluded me, leaped from his
            station, and, running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v3_126" n="122"/>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the
            room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
            boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless,
            most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured by my fancy. After
            having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different
            directions among the woods and vines.<anchor id="struct452b"/></p>

            parched with <app id="var4835"><lem>the</lem></app> heat of fever. In this state I lay on a <app id="var4836"><lem>bed,</lem></app> hardly conscious of what
            had <app id="var4837"><lem>happened;</lem></app> my eyes wandered round the <app id="var4838"><lem>room,</lem></app> as if to seek <app id="var4839"><lem>something</lem></app> that I had
            <app id="var4840"><lem>lost.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct454a"/>At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_127" n="123"/>of Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return
            alone. This reflection brought tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my
            thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting on my misfortunes, and their cause. I
            was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of
            Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not
            that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even
            now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea
            made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to
            Geneva with all possible speed.<anchor id="struct454b"/></p>

            <app id="var4844"><lem>unfavourable,</lem></app> and <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_128" n="124"/>the rain fell in torrents.
            <app id="var4845"><lem>However, it</lem></app> was <app id="var4846"><lem>hardly morning,</lem></app> and I <app id="var4847"><lem>might</lem></app> reasonably <app id="var4848"><lem>hope</lem></app> to arrive <app id="var4849"><lem>by night.</lem></app> I hired
            <app id="var4850"><lem>men</lem></app> to <app id="var4851"><lem>row,</lem></app> and took an oar <app id="var4852"><lem>myself,</lem></app> for I had always <app id="var4853"><lem>experienced</lem></app> relief <app id="var4854"><lem>from</lem></app> mental
            <app id="var4855"><lem>torment</lem></app> in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now <app id="var4856"><lem>felt, and</lem></app> the excess of
            agitation that I <app id="var4857"><lem>endured,</lem></app> rendered me incapable of any <app id="var4858"><lem>exertion. I</lem></app> threw down the <app id="var4859"><lem>oar;
            and,</lem></app> leaning my head upon my <app id="var4860"><lem>hands,</lem></app> gave way to every gloomy idea that <app id="var4861"><lem>arose. If</lem></app> I
            looked <app id="var4862"><lem>up,</lem></app> I saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier <app id="var4863"><lem>time,</lem></app> and which I

            lour; but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched

            so frightful an event is single in the history of man.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct456a"/>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event.

            flowery <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_131" n="127"/>meadows <app id="var4913"><lem>and</lem></app> pleasant vales with the
            friends of my <app id="var4914"><lem>youth;</lem></app> <app id="var4915"><lem>but awoke, and</lem></app> found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy <app id="var4916"><lem>followed,</lem></app> but
            by degrees I <app id="var4917"><lem>gained</lem></app> a clear conception of my miseries <app id="var4918"><lem>and situation, and</lem></app> was then
            released from my prison. For they had called me <app id="var4919"><lem>mad; and during</lem></app> many <app id="var4920"><lem>months,</lem></app> as I
            <app id="var4921"><lem>understood,</lem></app> a solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct459a"/>But liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the
            same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I
            began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon
            whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening
            rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_132" n="128"/>within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge
            on his cursed head.</p>
          <p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best
            means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired
            to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I
            knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority
            for the apprehension of the murderer.</p>
          <p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: “Be assured, sir,” said he,
            “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.”<anchor id="struct459b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct460a"/> <anchor id="struct460b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4922"><lem>“I</lem></app> thank you,” <app id="var4923"><lem>replied I; “listen, therefore,</lem></app> to <app id="var4924"><lem>the</lem></app> deposition <app id="var4925"><lem>that I</lem></app> have to <app id="var4926"><lem>make.</lem></app> It
            is <app id="var4927"><lem>indeed</lem></app> a tale so <app id="var4928"><lem>strange,</lem></app> that I <app id="var4929"><lem>should fear</lem></app> you would not credit <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_133" n="129"/><app id="var4930"><lem>it,</lem></app> were there not <app id="var4931"><lem>something</lem></app> in truth <app id="var4932"><lem>which,</lem></app> however
            <app id="var4933"><lem>wonderful,</lem></app> forces conviction. The story is too connected to be <app id="var4934"><lem>mistaken</lem></app> for a <app id="var4935"><lem>dream, and</lem></app>
            I have no motive for falsehood.” My <app id="var4936"><lem>manner,</lem></app> as I <app id="var4937"><lem>thus addressed him,</lem></app> was <app id="var4938"><lem>impressive,</lem></app> but
            calm; I had formed in my own heart <app id="var4939"><lem>a</lem></app> resolution to pursue my destroyer to <app id="var4940"><lem>death; and</lem></app>
            this purpose quieted my <app id="var4941"><lem>agony, and</lem></app> provisionally reconciled me to life. I now related my
            history <app id="var4942"><lem>briefly,</lem></app> but with firmness <app id="var4943"><lem>and precision,</lem></app> marking <app id="var4944"><lem>the dates</lem></app> with <app id="var4945"><lem>accuracy,</lem></app> and
            never deviating into invective or <app id="var4946"><lem>exclamation.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct461a"/>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became
            more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a
            lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v3_134" n="130"/>When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This
            is the being whom I accuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call upon you to
            exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that
            your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this
            occasion.”<anchor id="struct461b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct462a"/> <anchor id="struct462b"/></p>
          <p>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my auditor. He had
            heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and
            supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the
            whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly
            afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have
            powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_135" n="131"/>Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit
            caves and dens, where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed
            since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has
            wandered, or what region he may now inhabit.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct463a"/>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed
            taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of
            prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to
            pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”</p>
          <p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated; “You are
            mistaken,” said he, “I will <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_136" n="132"/>exert myself; and if
            it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment
            proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his
            properties, that this will prove impracticable, and that, while every proper measure is
            pursued, you should endeavour to make up your mind to disappointment.”<anchor id="struct463b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct465a"/><pb xml:id="F1818_v3_137" n="133"/>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said
            this; there was a phrenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty
            fierceness, which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
            magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and
            heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to
            soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale as the effects of
            delirium.</p>
          <p>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what
            it is you say.”</p>
          <p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on some other mode
            of action.</p>

          <p>M<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> present situation was one in which all voluntary thought
            was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with
            strength and composure; it modelled my feelings, and allowed me to be calculating and
            calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.</p>
          <p>My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy
            and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself
            with <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_139" n="135"/>a sum of money, together with a few jewels
            which had belonged to my mother, and departed.</p>
          <p>And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast
            portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which travellers, in deserts
            and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times
            have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But
            revenge kept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.<anchor id="struct465b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct468a"/>I had begun my abjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_142" n="138"/>assured me that the shades of my murdered friends
            heard and approved my devotion; but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage
            choaked my utterance.</p>
          <p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rung on
            my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell
            surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been
            possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my miserable existence, but that my vow was
            heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away: when a well-known
            and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—“I am
            satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1818_v3_143" n="139"/>I darted towards the spot from which the sound
            proceeded; but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and
            shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal
            speed.<anchor id="struct468b"/></p>

            a strange <app id="var5042"><lem>chance,</lem></app> I saw the fiend enter by <app id="var5043"><lem>night, and</lem></app> hide himself in a vessel bound for
            the <app id="var5044"><lem>Black Sea. I took my passage in</lem></app> the <app id="var5045"><lem>same ship; but he escaped, I know not</lem></app> <app id="var5046"><lem>how.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct470a"/>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever
            followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition,
            informed me of his <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_144" n="140"/>path; sometimes he himself, who
            feared that if I lost all trace I should despair and die, often left some mark to guide
            me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white
            plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can
            you understand what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the least
            pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried about with
            me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps, and, when
            I most murmured, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.
            Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a repast was
            prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited me. The fare was indeed <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_145" n="141"/>coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate; but
            I may not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.
            Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight
            cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.<anchor id="struct470b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct473a"/>What his feelings were whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks
            in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone, that guided me, and instigated my
            fury. “My reign is not yet over,” (these words were legible in one of these
            inscriptions); “you live, and my power is <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_148" n="144"/>complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the

          <p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to
            torture and death. Never will I omit my search, until he or I perish; and then with what

            <app id="var5105"><lem>increased</lem></app> in <app id="var5106"><lem>a</lem></app> degree almost too severe to support.

          <p><anchor id="struct475a"/>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription
            that he left was in these words: “Prepare! your toils only begin: wrap yourself in furs,
            and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will
            satisfy my everlasting hatred.”</p>
          <p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to
            fail in my purpose; and, calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated
            fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_150" n="146"/>ocean appeared at a distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how
            unlike it was to the blue seas of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be
            distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy
            when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the
            boundary of their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a full heart,
            thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped,

            and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon
            have sunk beneath this misery; when once, after</lem></app> the poor animals that carried me <app id="var5179"><lem>had</lem></app>

            <app id="var5191"><lem>be, and</lem></app> uttered a wild cry of <app id="var5192"><lem>ecstasy</lem></app> when I distinguished a <app id="var5193"><lem>sledge, and</lem></app> the distorted
            proportions of a <app id="var5194"><lem>well-known</lem></app> form <app id="var5195"><lem>within. Oh!</lem></app> with what a burning gush did hope revisit
            my <app id="var5196"><lem>heart!</lem></app> warm tears filled my <app id="var5197"><lem>eyes,</lem></app> which I hastily wiped <app id="var5198"><lem>away,</lem></app> that they might not
            <app id="var5199"><lem>intercept</lem></app> the view I had of the <app id="var5200"><lem>daemon;</lem></app> but still <app id="var5201"><lem>my sight was dimmed by the burn<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_155" n="151"/>ing drops, until,</lem></app> giving way to the emotions that
            oppressed <app id="var5202"><lem>me,</lem></app> I wept aloud.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct480a"/>But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion,
            gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely
            necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge
            was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a
            short time some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly
            gained on it; and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more
            than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.</p>
          <p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my enemy, my hopes were suddenly
            extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A
            ground sea <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_156" n="152"/>was heard; the thunder of its progress,
            as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and
            terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the
            mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming
            sound. The work was soon finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me
            and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was continually
            lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.<anchor id="struct480b"/></p>

          you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he shewed me, and the apparition of the

        <p>“Are you mad, my friend?” said he, “or whither does your senseless curio<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_161" n="157"/>sity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and
          the world a demoniacal enemy? Or to what do your questions tend? Peace, peace! learn my

        <p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them,
          and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but principally in giving
          the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved
          my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
          posterity.”<anchor id="struct487b"/></p>

        <p>Yet what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction,
          and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of
          despair, and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening failings of

        <p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly probable
          that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.</p>
        <p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in
          their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already
          found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health:
          a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused
          to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.<anchor id="struct495b"/></p>

        <p><app id="var5443"><lem>I</lem></app> mentioned <app id="var5444"><lem>in my</lem></app> last letter the fears I <app id="var5445"><lem>entertained</lem></app> of <app id="var5446"><lem>a mutiny.</lem></app> This <app id="var5447"><lem>morning,</lem></app> as I sat
          watching the wan countenance of my <app id="var5448"><lem>friend—his</lem></app> eyes <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_171" n="167"/>half <app id="var5449"><lem>closed,</lem></app> and his limbs hanging <app id="var5450"><lem>listlessly,—I</lem></app> was <app id="var5451"><lem>roused</lem></app> by half a dozen of the
          <app id="var5452"><lem>sailors,</lem></app> who desired admission into the <app id="var5453"><lem>cabin. They entered; and</lem></app> their leader <app id="var5454"><lem>addressed</lem></app>
          me. He told me that he <app id="var5455"><lem>and</lem></app> his <app id="var5456"><lem>companions</lem></app> had been chosen by the other sailors to come in
          deputation to <app id="var5457"><lem>me,</lem></app> to make <app id="var5458"><lem>me a demand, which,</lem></app> in <app id="var5459"><lem>justice,</lem></app> I could not refuse. We were
          immured <app id="var5460"><lem>in ice, and should</lem></app> probably never <app id="var5461"><lem>escape;</lem></app> but they feared that if, as was
          <app id="var5462"><lem>possible,</lem></app> the ice should <app id="var5463"><lem>dissipate,</lem></app> and a free passage <app id="var5464"><lem>be opened,</lem></app> I should be rash enough

          <app id="var5470"><lem>surmounted</lem></app> this. They <app id="var5471"><lem>desired, therefore,</lem></app> that I should <app id="var5472"><lem>engage with</lem></app> a solemn <app id="var5473"><lem>promise,</lem></app> that
          <app id="var5474"><lem>if</lem></app> the vessel should be freed, <app id="var5475"><lem>I would instantly direct my course southward.</lem></app></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct497a"/>This speech troubled me. I had <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_172" n="168"/>not despaired; nor
          had I yet conceived the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even
          in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein, who
          had at first been silent, and indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now
          roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning
          towards the men, he said—<anchor id="struct497b"/></p>

          purposes, and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts might be;
          it is mutable, cannot withstand you, if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your
          families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have
          fought and conquered, and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”</lem></app></p>

        <p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?
          What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I
          should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a

          I shall <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_194" n="190"/>die. I shall no longer feel the <app id="var5808"><lem>agonies

          happiness. Some years <app id="var5821"><lem>ago,</lem></app> when the <app id="var5822"><lem>first images which this</lem></app> world affords first opened
          <app id="var5823"><lem>upon me,</lem></app> when I felt the cheering warmth of <app id="var5824"><lem>summer, and</lem></app> heard the rustling of <app id="var5825"><lem>the leaves
          and</lem></app> the chirping of <app id="var5826"><lem>the birds, and</lem></app> these were all to <app id="var5827"><lem>me,</lem></app> I should have wept to <app id="var5828"><lem>die;</lem></app> now it
          is my only consolation. <app id="var5829"><lem>Polluted</lem></app> by <app id="var5830"><lem>crimes,</lem></app> and torn by the bitterest <app id="var5831"><lem>remorse,</lem></app> where can I
          find <app id="var5832"><lem>rest</lem></app> but in <app id="var5833"><lem>death?</lem></app></p>

          be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral
            <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_196" n="192"/>pile triumphantly, and exult in the agony of the
          torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept
          into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace; or if it thinks, it will not
          surely think thus. Farewell.”</p>
        <p>He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to
          the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and distance.</p>
