      <p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by
        Dr. Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of impossible
        occurrence. I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to
        such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not
        considered myself as merely <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_013" n="vi"/>weaving a series of
        supernatural terrors. The event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from
        the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended by the
        novelty of the situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical fact,
        affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions more
        comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can
        yield.</p>
      <p>I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_014" n="vii"/>principles of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate upon their
        combinations. The Iliad, the tragic poetry of Greece,—Shakespeare, in the Tempest and
        Midsummer Night’s Dream,—and most especially Milton, in Paradise Lost, conform to this rule;
        and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive amusement from his labours,
        may, without presumption, apply to prose fiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the
        adoption of which so many exquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the
        highest specimens of poetry.</p>
      <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_015" n="viii"/>The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested
        in casual conversation. It was commenced, partly as a source of amusement, and partly as an
        expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind. Other motives were mingled with
        these, as the work proceeded. I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever
        moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader;
        yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding the enervating effects
        of the novels of the present day, and to the exhibition <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_016" n="ix"/>of
        the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions
        which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be
        conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn
        from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind.</p>
      <p>It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this story was begun in the
        majestic region where the scene is principally laid, and in society which cannot cease to
          <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_017" n="x"/>be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the environs
        of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we crowded around a blazing
        wood fire, and occasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which
        happened to fall into our hands. These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation.
        Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the
        public than any thing I can ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story,
        founded on some supernatural occurrence.</p>
      <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_018" n="xi"/>The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two
        friends left me on a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which they
        present, all memory of their ghostly visions. The following tale is the only one which has
        been completed.</p>

        <p> St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.</p>
        <p>Y<hi rend="smallcaps">OU</hi> will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
          commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I
          arrived here yesterday; and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare, and
          increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.</p>
        <p>I am already far north of London; and as I walk in the streets of Peters<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_021" n="2"/>burgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks,
          which braces my nerves, and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This
          breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a
          foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my day dreams become
          more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost
          and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and
          delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the
          horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will
          put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing
          over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_022" n="3"/>in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
          globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the
          heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected
          in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the
          needle; and may regulate a thousand celestial observations, that require only this voyage
          to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent
          curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land
          never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are
          sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death, and to induce me to commence this
          laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_023" n="4"/>embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
          native river. But, supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the
          inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by
          discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many
          months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all
          possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
        <p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel
          my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven; for nothing contributes so
          much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose,—a point on which the soul may fix its
          intellectual eye. This expedition has been <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_024" n="5"/>the favourite
          dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which
          have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas
          which surround the pole. You may remember, that a history of all the voyages made for
          purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle Thomas’s library. My education
          was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and
          night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on
          learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in
          a sea-faring life.</p>
        <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions
          entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_025" n="6"/>and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation; I
          imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and
          Shakspeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure, and how heavily I
          bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and
          my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>
        <p>Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now,
          remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by
          inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the
          North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked
          harder than the common sailors during the day, and devoted my <pb xml:id="Fv1_1823_026" n="7"/>nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of
          physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical
          advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and
          acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud, when my captain offered
          me the second dignity in the vessel, and entreated me to remain with the greatest
          earnestness; so valuable did he consider my services.</p>
        <p>And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might
          have been passed in ease and luxury; but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth
          placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My
          courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_027" n="8"/>and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult
          voyage; the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to
          raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when their’s are
          failing.</p>
        <p>This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the
          snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than
          that of an English stage-coach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapt in furs, a
          dress which I have already adopted; for there is a great difference between walking the
          deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from
          actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road
          between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_028" n="9"/>I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or
          three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying
          the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among
          those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail until the month of
          June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I
          succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail,
          you will see me again soon, or never.<anchor id="struct4b"/></p>

        <p>Archangel, 28th March, 17—.</p>
        <p>How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow; yet a second step
          is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel, and am occupied in collecting my
          sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are
          certainly possessed of dauntless courage.</p>
        <p>But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_030" n="11"/>the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most
          severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success,
          there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will
          endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but
          that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who
          could sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my
          dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
          courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are
          like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of
          your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_031" n="12"/>and too
          impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated:
          for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our
          uncle Thomas’s books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets
          of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
          most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of becoming
          acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight, and
          am in reality more illiterate than many school-boys of fifteen. It is true that I have
          thought more, and that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want (as
          the painters call it) <hi rend="italic">keeping;</hi> and I greatly need a friend who
          would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_032" n="13"/>enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.</p>
        <p>Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean,
          nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the
          dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a
          man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory. He is an
          Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by
          cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted
          with him on board a whale vessel: finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily
          engaged him to assist in my enterprise.</p>
        <p>The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in the ship for his
          gentleness and the mild<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_033" n="14"/>ness of his discipline. He is,
          indeed, of so amiable a nature, that he will not hunt (a favourite, and almost the only
          amusement here), because he cannot endure to spill blood. He is, moreover, heroically
          generous. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and having
          amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.
          He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and,
          throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that
          she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the
          union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of
          her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money,
            <pb xml:id="Fv1_1823_034" n="15"/>on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his
          life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money
          to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman‘s father to consent to her
          marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in
          honour to my friend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor
          returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
          inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is so; but then he has passed
          all his life on board a vessel, and has scarcely an idea beyond the rope and the
          shroud.</p>
        <p>But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because I can conceive a
          consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_035" n="16"/>in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate; and my
          voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has
          been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably
          early season; so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing
          rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever
          the safety of others is committed to my care.</p>
        <p>I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is
          impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable
          and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions,
          to “the land of mist and snow;” but I shall kill no albatross, therefore do not be alarmed
          for my safety.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_036" n="17"/>Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense
          seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such
          success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue to write to me
          by every opportunity: I may receive your letters (though the chance is very doubtful) on
          some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
          Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.</p>

        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">MY DEAR SISTER</hi>,</p>
        <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">WRITE</hi> a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well
          advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its
          homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land,
          perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold, and apparently
          firm of purpose; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indi<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_038" n="19"/>cating the dangers of the region towards which we are
          advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is
          the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which
          blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a
          degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.</p>
        <p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two
          stiff gales, and the breaking of a mast, are accidents which experienced navigators
          scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us
          during our voyage.</p>
        <p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not
          rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.</p>

        <p>August 5th, 17—.</p>
        <p>So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear recording it, although
          it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your
          possession.</p>
        <p>Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on
          all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she floated. Our situation was
          somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We
          accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_041" n="21"/>take
          place in the atmosphere and weather.</p>
        <p>About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction,
          vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades
          groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange
          sight suddenly attracted our attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own
          situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on
          towards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the shape of a man,
          but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge, and guided the dogs. We watched the
          rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant
          inequalities of the ice.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_042" n="23"/>This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We
          were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to
          denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
          ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest
          attention.</p>
        <p>About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and before night the ice
          broke, and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in
          the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I
          profited of this time to rest for a few hours.</p>
        <p>In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and found all the
          sailors busy on one side of <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_043" n="24"/>the vessel, apparently
          talking to some one in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before,
          which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog
          remained alive; but there was a human being within it, whom the sailors were persuading to
          enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
          some undiscovered island, but an European. When I appeared on deck, the master said, “Here
          is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.”</p>
        <p>On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.
          “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he, “will you have the kindness to inform me
          whither you are bound?”</p>
        <p>You may conceive my astonishment <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_044" n="25"/>on hearing such a
          question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have
          supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for
          the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a
          voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board. Good God!
          Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would
          have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by
          fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry
          him into the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted. We
          accordingly brought <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_045" n="26"/>him back to the deck, and restored
          him to animation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.
          As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets, and placed him near the
          chimney of the kitchen-stove. By slow degrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which
          restored him wonderfully.</p>
        <p>Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often feared that his
          sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I
          removed him to my own cabin, and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never
          saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and
          even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act of kindness towards
          him, or does <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_046" n="27"/>him any the most trifling service, his
          whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that
          I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing; and sometimes he
          gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.</p>
        <p>When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished
          to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle
          curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire
          repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so
          strange a vehicle?</p>
        <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_047" n="28"/>replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”<anchor id="struct6b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct7a"/><app id="var4"><lem>“And did the man whom you pursued travel in</lem></app> the <app id="var5"><lem>same fashion?”</lem></app><anchor id="struct7b"/></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct8a"/>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Then I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up, we saw some dogs
          drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”</p>
        <p>This aroused the stranger’s attention; and he asked a multitude of questions concerning
          the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone
          with me, he said, “I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these
          good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”</p>
        <p>“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any
          inquisitiveness of mine.”</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_048" n="29"/>“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous
          situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.”</p>
        <p>Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed
          the other sledge? I replied, that I could not answer with any degree of certainty; for the
          ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of
          safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.</p>
        <p>From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to watch for the sledge
          which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far
          too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. But I have promised that some one
          should watch for him, and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in
          sight.</p>
        <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_049" n="30"/>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange
          occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is
          very silent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin. Yet his
          manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all interested in him,
          although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to
          love him as a brother; and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and
          compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
          so attractive and amiable.</p>
        <p>I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide
          ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should
          have been <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_050" n="31"/>happy to have possessed as the brother of my
          heart.</p>
        <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh
          incidents to record.</p>
        <anchor xml:id="C06"/>
        <p>August 13th, 17—.</p>
        <p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my
          pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery
          without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so
          cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet
          they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.</p>
        <p>He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently
          watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although un<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_051" n="32"/>happy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests
          himself deeply in the employments of others. He has asked me many questions concerning my
          design; and I have related my little history frankly to him. He appeared pleased with the
          confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall find exceedingly
          useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears to spring solely from
          the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. He is often
          overcome by gloom, and then he sits by himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen
          or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass from him like a cloud from before the sun,
          though his dejection never leaves him. I have endeavoured to win his confidence; and I
          trust that I have suc<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_052" n="33"/>ceeded. One day I mentioned to him
          the desire I had always felt of finding a friend who might sympathise with me, and direct
          me by his counsel. I said, I did not belong to that class of men who are offended by
          advice. “I am self-educated, and perhaps I hardly rely sufficiently upon my own powers. I
          wish, therefore, that my companion should be wiser and more experienced than myself, to
          confirm and support me; nor have I believed it impossible to find a true friend.”</p>
        <p>“I agree with you,” replied the stranger, “in believing that friendship is not only a
          desirable, but a possible acquisition. I once had a friend, the most noble of human
          creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and
          the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_053" n="34"/>lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew.”</p>
        <p>As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched
          me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin.</p>
        <p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of
          nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions,
          seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double
          existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he has
          retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo around him,
          within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.</p>
        <p>Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wan<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_054" n="35"/>derer? If you do, you must have certainly lost that
          simplicity which was once your characteristic charm. Yet, if you will, smile at the warmth
          of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for repeating them.</p>
        <p>August 19th, 17—.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have
          suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, once, that the memory of
          these evils should die with me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek
          for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of
          your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the
          relation of my misfortunes will be useful to you; yet, if <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_055" n="36"/>you are inclined, listen to my tale. I believe that the strange incidents connected with
          it will afford a view of nature, which may enlarge your faculties and understanding. You
          will hear of powers and occurrences, such as you have been accustomed to believe
          impossible: but I do not doubt that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the
          truth of the events of which it is composed.”</p>
        <p>You may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I
          could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt
          the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly
          from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these
          feelings in my answer.</p>
        <p>“I thank you,” he replied, “for <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_056" n="37"/>your sympathy, but it
          is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose
          in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt
          him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can
          alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
          determined.”</p>
        <p>He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at
          leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I
          am not engaged, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related
          during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will
          doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but to me, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_057" n="38"/>who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what interest and sympathy shall I
          read it in some future day!</p>

          <head><anchor id="struct11a"/>CHAPTER I.</head>
          <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">AM</hi> by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most
            distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
            syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
            He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to
            public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his
            country; <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_059" n="40"/>and it was not until the decline of life that
            he thought of marrying, and bestowing on the state sons who might carry his virtues and
            his name down to posterity.</p>
          <p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from
            relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing
            state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was
            Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in
            poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
            his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable
            manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown
            and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_060" n="41"/>friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate
            circumstances. He grieved also for the loss of his society, and resolved to seek him
            out, and endeavour to persuade him to begin the world again through his credit and
            assistance.</p>
          <p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before
            my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house,
            which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and
            despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the
            wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some
            months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
            merchant’s house. The <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_061" n="42"/>interval was consequently spent
            in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling, when he had leisure for
            reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three
            months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
          <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with despair that
            their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
            support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage
            rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by
            various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>
          <p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_062" n="43"/>was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means
            of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
            her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt by Beaufort’s
            coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting
            spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and after the interment of
            his friend, he conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a
            relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.</p>
          <p>When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so occupied by the
            duties of his new situation, that he relinquished many of his public employments, and
            devoted himself to the education of his children. Of these I was the eldest, and the
            destined suc<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_063" n="44"/>cessor to all his labours and utility. No
            creature could have more tender parents than mine. My improvement and health were their
            constant care, especially as I remained for several years their only child. But before I
            continue my narrative, I must record an incident which took place when I was four years
            of age.</p>
          <p>My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married early in life an
            Italian gentleman. Soon after her marriage, she had accompanied her husband into his
            native country, and for some years my father had very little communication with her.
            About the time I mentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter
            from her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an Italian lady, and
            requesting my father to take charge of the in<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_064" n="45"/>fant
            Elizabeth, the only child of his deceased sister. “It is my wish,” he said, "that you
            should consider her as your own daughter, and educate her thus. Her mother's fortune is
            secured to her, the documents of which I will commit to your keeping. Reflect upon this
            proposition; and decide whether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her
            being brought up by a stepmother.”</p>
          <p>My father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he might accompany the
            little Elizabeth to her future home. I have often heard my mother say, that she was at
            that time the most beautiful child she had ever seen, and showed signs even then of a
            gentle and affectionate disposition. These indications, and a desire to bind as closely
            as possible the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to consider Elizabeth <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_065" n="46"/>as my future wife; a design which she never found reason
            to repent.</p>
          <p>From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew older, my
            friend. She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful as a summer insect.
            Although she was lively and animated, her feelings were strong and deep, and her
            disposition uncommonly affectionate. No one could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could
            submit with more grace than she did to constraint and caprice. Her imagination was
            luxuriant, yet her capability of application was great. Her person was the image of her
            mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird’s, possessed an attractive softness.
            Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable of enduring great fatigue, she
            appeared the most fragile creature in the world. While I admired her under<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_066" n="47"/>standing and fancy, I loved to tend on her, as I should
            on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace both of person and mind united to
            so little pretension.<anchor id="struct11b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct12a"/><app id="var7"><lem>Every one adored Elizabeth. If the servants had any request to make, it was always
            through her intercession. We were strangers to any species of disunion and dispute; for
            although there was a great dissimilitude in our characters, there was an harmony in that
            very dissimilitude. I was more calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my temper
            was not so yielding. My application was of longer endurance; but it was not so severe

            constantly with us. He went to school with me, and generally passed the afternoon at our
            house; for being an only child, and destitute of companions at home, his father was well
            pleased that he should find associates at our house; and we were never completely happy
            when Clerval was absent.</p>
          <p>I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had
            tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and
            narrow reflections upon self. But, in drawing the picture of my early days, I must not
            omit to record those events which led, by in<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_070" n="51"/>sensible
            steps, to my after tale of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of
            that passion, which afterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river,
            from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the
            torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.<anchor id="struct15b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var77"><lem>Natural</lem></app> philosophy <app id="var78"><lem>is</lem></app> the genius that has regulated my <app id="var79"><lem>fate;</lem></app> I <app id="var80"><lem>desire therefore,</lem></app> in
            this <app id="var81"><lem>narration,</lem></app> to state those facts which led to my <app id="var82"><lem>predilection</lem></app> for that science. When
            I was <app id="var83"><lem>thirteen</lem></app> years <app id="var84"><lem>of age,</lem></app> we all went on a party of pleasure to <app id="var85"><lem>the</lem></app> baths near
            <app id="var86"><lem>Thonon: the inclemency</lem></app> of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In
            this house I chanced to <app id="var87"><lem>find</lem></app> a <app id="var88"><lem>volume</lem></app> of the <app id="var89"><lem>works</lem></app> of <app id="var90"><lem>Cornelius</lem></app> Agrippa. <app id="var91"><lem>I</lem></app> opened it
            with <app id="var92"><lem>apathy;</lem></app> the theory <app id="var93"><lem>which</lem></app> he <app id="var94"><lem>attempts</lem></app> to <app id="var95"><lem>demonstrate,</lem></app> and the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_071" n="52"/>wonderful facts <app id="var96"><lem>which</lem></app> he <app id="var97"><lem>relates,</lem></app> soon changed this
            feeling into <app id="var98"><lem>enthusiasm.</lem></app> A new light <app id="var99"><lem>seemed to dawn</lem></app> upon my <app id="var100"><lem>mind; and,</lem></app> bounding with
            <app id="var101"><lem>joy,</lem></app> I communicated my discovery to my father. I cannot help <app id="var102"><lem>remarking here the</lem></app> many
            opportunities <app id="var103"><lem>instructors possess</lem></app> of directing the attention of their pupils to useful
            knowledge, which they utterly neglect. My father looked carelessly at the <app id="var104"><lem>title-page</lem></app> of
            my <app id="var105"><lem>book,</lem></app> and <app id="var106"><lem>said,</lem></app> “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! <app id="var107"><lem>My</lem></app> dear <app id="var108"><lem>Victor,</lem></app> do not waste your time upon
            <app id="var109"><lem>this;</lem></app> it is sad <app id="var110"><lem>trash.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><app id="var111"><lem>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the
            principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that</lem></app> a modern system of science
            had been <app id="var112"><lem>introduced,</lem></app> which possessed much greater <app id="var113"><lem>powers</lem></app> than the <app id="var114"><lem>ancient,</lem></app> because the
            powers of the <app id="var115"><lem>latter</lem></app> were <app id="var116"><lem>chimerical,</lem></app> while those <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_072" n="53"/>of
            the <app id="var117"><lem>former were</lem></app> real and practical; under such <app id="var118"><lem>circumstances,</lem></app> I should certainly have
            thrown Agrippa aside, <app id="var119"><lem>and,</lem></app> with my imagination warmed as it <app id="var120"><lem>was, should</lem></app> probably have
            <app id="var121"><lem>applied</lem></app> myself to <app id="var122"><lem>the</lem></app> more <app id="var123"><lem>rational</lem></app> theory of chemistry which has <app id="var124"><lem>resulted</lem></app> from modern
            <app id="var125"><lem>discoveries.</lem></app> It is even <app id="var126"><lem>possible,</lem></app> that the train of my ideas <app id="var127"><lem>would</lem></app> never have <app id="var128"><lem>received
            the</lem></app> fatal impulse <app id="var129"><lem>that</lem></app> led <app id="var130"><lem>to</lem></app> my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my
            volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with <app id="var131"><lem>its</lem></app> contents; and I continued
            to read with the <app id="var132"><lem>greadest <comment text="RM: sic"/> avidity.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct16a"/>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and
            afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of

            secret stores of knowledge to my father, yet his indefinite censure of my favourite
            Agrippa always withheld me. I disclosed my discoveries to Elizabeth, therefore, under a
            promise of strict secrecy; but she did not interest herself in the subject, and I was
            left by her to pursue my studies alone.<anchor id="struct16b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var151"><lem>Nor</lem></app> were these my only <app id="var152"><lem>visions. The</lem></app> raising of ghosts or devils <app id="var153"><lem>was a</lem></app> promise liberally
            accorded by <app id="var154"><lem>my</lem></app> favourite <app id="var155"><lem>authors,</lem></app> the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; <app id="var156"><lem>and</lem></app> if
            my incantations were always <app id="var157"><lem>unsuccessful, I attributed</lem></app> the failure rather to my own

          <p><anchor id="struct18a"/>The natural phenomena that take place every day before our eyes did not escape my
            examinations. Distillation, and the wonderful effects of steam, processes of which my
            favourite authors were utterly ignorant, excited my astonishment; but my utmost wonder
            was <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_075" n="56"/>engaged by some experiments on an airpump, which I
            saw employed by a gentleman whom we were in the habit of visiting.</p>
          <p>The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several other points served to

            last, was entirely incomprehensible to me. The professor discoursed with the greatest
            fluency of potassium and boron, of sulphates and oxyds, terms to which I could affix no

            Elizabeth and I had been his constant nurses; his disposition was gentle, but he was

            gushed from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at my departure,

            M. <app id="var381"><lem>Krempe, professor</lem></app> of <app id="var382"><lem>natural</lem></app> philosophy. He received me with politeness, and asked me
            several questions concerning my progress in the <app id="var383"><lem>different</lem></app> branches of science
            appertaining to natural philosophy. I mentioned, it is <app id="var384"><lem>true,</lem></app> with fear and trembling,
            the only authors I had <app id="var385"><lem>ever</lem></app> read upon those subjects. The professor <app id="var386"><lem>stared:</lem></app> “Have <app id="var387"><lem>you,”
            he said, “really</lem></app> spent your time in studying such <app id="var388"><lem>nonsense?”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct40a"/>I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with warmth, “every
            instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have
            burdened your memory with exploded systems, and useless names. Good God! in what <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_089" n="70"/>desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough
            to inform you that these fancies, which you have so greedily imbibed, are a thousand
            years old, and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected in this enlightened and
            scientific age to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear Sir, you
            must begin your studies entirely anew.”<anchor id="struct40b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var389"><lem>So saying,</lem></app> he <app id="var390"><lem>stept</lem></app> aside, and <app id="var391"><lem>wrote</lem></app> down a list of several books <app id="var392"><lem>treating of</lem></app> natural
            <app id="var393"><lem>philosophy,</lem></app> which he desired me to <app id="var394"><lem>procure,</lem></app> and dismissed <app id="var395"><lem>me,</lem></app> after mentioning that <app id="var396"><lem>in</lem></app>
            the beginning of the <app id="var397"><lem>following</lem></app> week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon
            natural philosophy <app id="var398"><lem>in its general relations,</lem></app> and that M. <app id="var399"><lem>Waldman,</lem></app> a <app id="var400"><lem>fellow-professor,</lem></app>
            would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days <app id="var401"><lem>that</lem></app> he missed.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct42a"/>I returned home, not disappointed, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_090" n="71"/>for I had long
            considered those authors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I
            did not feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his recommendation. M.
            Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and repulsive countenance; the
            teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his doctrine. Besides, I had a
            contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different, when the
            masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were
            grand: but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
            itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly
            founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of
            little worth.<anchor id="struct42b"/></p>

            <app id="var411"><lem>pulpit,</lem></app> I recollected what he had said of <app id="var412"><lem>M. Waldman,</lem></app> whom I had never <app id="var413"><lem>seen,</lem></app> as he had

          <p><app id="var416"><lem>Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which
            M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He
            appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest
            benevolence; a few gray hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head
            were nearly black. His person</lem></app> was <app id="var417"><lem>short,</lem></app> but remarkably <app id="var418"><lem>erect;</lem></app> and his <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_092" n="73"/>voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his
            lecture <app id="var419"><lem>by</lem></app> a <app id="var420"><lem>recapitulation</lem></app> of <app id="var421"><lem>the history</lem></app> of chemistry and <app id="var422"><lem>the</lem></app> various improvements
            <app id="var423"><lem>made by different men</lem></app> of <app id="var424"><lem>learning, pronouncing with fervour</lem></app> the names of the <app id="var425"><lem>most
            distinguished discoverers.</lem></app> He then took a cursory view of the present state of <app id="var426"><lem>the</lem></app>
            science, and explained many of its <app id="var427"><lem>elementary</lem></app> terms. <app id="var428"><lem>After having made</lem></app> a few preparatory
            <app id="var429"><lem>experiments, he concluded</lem></app> with a panegyric upon <app id="var430"><lem>modern chemistry,</lem></app> the <app id="var431"><lem>terms</lem></app> of which I
            shall never <app id="var432"><lem>forget:—</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct45a"/>“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he, “promised impossibilities, and
            performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot
            be transmuted, and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, whose
            hands seem only made to dabble in <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_093" n="74"/>dirt, and their eyes
            to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate
            into the recesses of nature, and show how she works in her hiding places. They ascend
            into the heavens: they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the
            air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the
            thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own

            was</lem></app> replaced by the greatest <app id="var440"><lem>affability</lem></app> and <app id="var441"><lem>kindness.</lem></app> He heard <app id="var442"><lem>with attention</lem></app> my <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_094" n="75"/>little narration concerning my <app id="var443"><lem>studies, and</lem></app> smiled at
            the names of Cornelius Agrippa and <app id="var444"><lem>Paracelsus,</lem></app> but without the contempt that <app id="var445"><lem>M.</lem></app> Krempe
            had <app id="var446"><lem>exhibited. He said, that “these were men</lem></app> to <app id="var447"><lem>whose indefatigable zeal modern
            philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left
            to us, as an easier task, to give new names, and arrange in connected classifications,
            the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.
            The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in
            ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”</lem></app> I <app id="var448"><lem>listened to his statement,
            which was delivered without any presumption or affectation; and then added,</lem></app> that his
            lecture had removed my <app id="var449"><lem>prejudices</lem></app> against modern <app id="var450"><lem>chemists;</lem></app> and <app id="var451"><lem>I,</lem></app> at the same <app id="var452"><lem>time,
              re<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_095" n="76"/>quested</lem></app> his advice concerning the books I ought to
            <app id="var453"><lem>procure.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct47a"/> <anchor id="struct47b"/></p>
          <p>“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a disciple; and if your application
            equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of
            natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made: it is
            on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not
            neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he
            attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a
            man of science, and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to
            every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct48a"/> <anchor id="struct48b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var454"><lem>He then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of his <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_096" n="77"/>various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to
            procure, and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in
            the science not to derange their</lem></app> mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I
            had <app id="var455"><lem>requested;</lem></app> and I took my <app id="var456"><lem>leave.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct49a"/>Thus ended a day memorable to me: it decided my future destiny.</p>

          <p><app id="var457"><lem>From</lem></app> this day natural <app id="var458"><lem>philosophy,</lem></app> and <app id="var459"><lem>particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive
            sense of the term,</lem></app> became <app id="var460"><lem>nearly</lem></app> my sole <app id="var461"><lem>occupation.</lem></app> I read with ardour <app id="var462"><lem>those works,</lem></app> so
            full of genius and <app id="var463"><lem>discrimination, which modern inquirers</lem></app> have <app id="var464"><lem>written</lem></app> on these
            <app id="var465"><lem>subjects.</lem></app> I attended the lectures, and <app id="var466"><lem>cultivated</lem></app> the <app id="var467"><lem>acquaintance,</lem></app> of the men of
            science of the university; and I found even in <app id="var468"><lem>M.</lem></app> Krempe a great deal of sound sense <app id="var469"><lem>and</lem></app>
            real <app id="var470"><lem>information, combined,</lem></app> it is <app id="var471"><lem>true,</lem></app> with a repulsive <app id="var472"><lem>physiognomy and</lem></app> manners, but
            not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_098" n="79"/>a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by <app id="var473"><lem>dogmatism;</lem></app> and his
            instructions were given with an air of frankness and good <app id="var474"><lem>nature,</lem></app> that banished every
            idea of <app id="var475"><lem>pedantry.</lem></app> It <app id="var476"><lem>was, perhaps,</lem></app> the amiable character of this man that <app id="var477"><lem>inclined</lem></app> me
            more to <app id="var478"><lem>that</lem></app> branch of <app id="var479"><lem>natural</lem></app> philosophy which he <app id="var480"><lem>professed,</lem></app> than an intrinsic love for
            the science itself. But this <app id="var481"><lem>state of mind had place</lem></app> only in the first steps towards
            <app id="var482"><lem>knowledge:</lem></app> the more fully I entered <app id="var483"><lem>into</lem></app> the <app id="var484"><lem>science,</lem></app> the more <app id="var485"><lem>exclusively I pursued</lem></app> it
            for its own sake. That <app id="var486"><lem>application,</lem></app> which at first had been a matter of <app id="var487"><lem>duty and</lem></app>
            resolution, now became so ardent and <app id="var488"><lem>eager,</lem></app> that the stars often <app id="var489"><lem>disappeared in the
            light of morning whilst</lem></app> I was yet <app id="var490"><lem>engaged</lem></app> in my <app id="var491"><lem>laboratory.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct51a"/> <anchor id="struct51b"/></p>
          <p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved <app id="var492"><lem>ra<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_099" n="80"/>pidly.</lem></app> My ardour was indeed the <app id="var493"><lem>astonishment</lem></app> of the
            <app id="var494"><lem>students;</lem></app> and my <app id="var495"><lem>proficiency,</lem></app> that of the <app id="var496"><lem>masters.</lem></app> Professor Krempe often asked <app id="var497"><lem>me,</lem></app> with
            a sly <app id="var498"><lem>smile,</lem></app> how Cornelius Agrippa went <app id="var499"><lem>on? whilst M. Waldman expressed the most
            heartfelt exultation in my progress.</lem></app> Two years passed in this <app id="var500"><lem>manner,</lem></app> during which I
            paid no visit to Geneva, but <app id="var501"><lem>was engaged,</lem></app> heart and <app id="var502"><lem>soul,</lem></app> in the pursuit of some
            <app id="var503"><lem>discoveries,</lem></app> which I hoped to make. <app id="var504"><lem>None</lem></app> but those who have experienced <app id="var505"><lem>them</lem></app> can
            conceive of the enticements of <app id="var506"><lem>science.</lem></app> In other studies you go as far as others have
            <app id="var507"><lem>gone</lem></app> before <app id="var508"><lem>you,</lem></app> and there is nothing more to <app id="var509"><lem>know;</lem></app> but in a scientific pursuit <app id="var510"><lem>there</lem></app> is
            continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of <app id="var511"><lem>moderate capacity, which</lem></app> closely
            pursues one <app id="var512"><lem>study,</lem></app> must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in <app id="var513"><lem>that study; and I,</lem></app> who
              <app id="var514"><lem>con<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_100" n="81"/>tinually sought</lem></app> the attainment of one <app id="var515"><lem>object of
            pursuit,</lem></app> and was <app id="var516"><lem>solely wrapt</lem></app> up <app id="var517"><lem>in this,</lem></app> improved so <app id="var518"><lem>rapidly, that,</lem></app> at the end of <app id="var519"><lem>two
            years,</lem></app> I made <app id="var520"><lem>some discoveries</lem></app> in the improvement of some chemical <app id="var521"><lem>instruments,</lem></app> which
            <app id="var522"><lem>procured</lem></app> me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I <app id="var523"><lem>had arrived</lem></app> at this
            <app id="var524"><lem>point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural
            philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my</lem></app>
            residence <app id="var525"><lem>there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to
            my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct52a"/> <anchor id="struct52b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var526"><lem>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted</lem></app> my <app id="var527"><lem>attention was the structure of
            the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself,
            did the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_101" n="82"/>principle of life proceed? It was a bold
            question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things
            are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did</lem></app> not
            <app id="var528"><lem>restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind, and determined
            thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy
            which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural
            enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome, and almost
            intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I
            became acquainted with the science of anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also
            observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father
            had taken the greatest precautions that my mind <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_102" n="83"/>should
            be impressed with</lem></app> no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember <app id="var529"><lem>to have</lem></app> trembled at a
            <app id="var530"><lem>tale</lem></app> of <app id="var531"><lem>superstition,</lem></app> or to have feared the apparition of a <app id="var532"><lem>spirit.</lem></app> Darkness had no
            effect upon my <app id="var533"><lem>fancy;</lem></app> and a churchyard was to me merely <app id="var534"><lem>the</lem></app> receptacle of <app id="var535"><lem>bodies</lem></app>
            deprived of <app id="var536"><lem>life, which,</lem></app> from being the seat of beauty <app id="var537"><lem>and strength, had</lem></app> become food for
            the worm. <app id="var538"><lem>Now</lem></app> I was <app id="var539"><lem>led</lem></app> to examine the cause <app id="var540"><lem>and</lem></app> progress of this <app id="var541"><lem>decay,</lem></app> and forced to
            spend days and nights in vaults and <app id="var542"><lem>charnel-houses.</lem></app> My attention was fixed upon every
            <app id="var543"><lem>object the</lem></app> most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. <app id="var544"><lem>I</lem></app> saw how the fine
            form of <app id="var545"><lem>man</lem></app> was <app id="var546"><lem>degraded</lem></app> and <app id="var547"><lem>wasted;</lem></app> I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the
            <app id="var548"><lem>blooming</lem></app> cheek of <app id="var549"><lem>life;</lem></app> I saw how the worm <app id="var550"><lem>inherited</lem></app> the wonders of the eye and brain. I
            paused, <app id="var551"><lem>examining</lem></app> and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_103" n="84"/><app id="var552"><lem>analysing all the</lem></app> minutiæ of
            <app id="var553"><lem>causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until</lem></app>
            from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon <app id="var554"><lem>me—a</lem></app> light so brilliant <app id="var555"><lem>and
            wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect
            which it illustrated, I was surprised, that among so many men of genius who had directed
            their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so
            astonishing a secret.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct53a"/> <anchor id="struct53b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var556"><lem>Remember,</lem></app> I am <app id="var557"><lem>not</lem></app> recording the <app id="var558"><lem>vision of</lem></app> a <app id="var559"><lem>madman.</lem></app> <app id="var560"><lem>The</lem></app> sun does not more certainly

            produced <app id="var564"><lem>it, yet</lem></app> the stages of <app id="var565"><lem>the discovery</lem></app> were distinct and probable. After days and
            nights of incredible <app id="var566"><lem>labour</lem></app> and <app id="var567"><lem>fatigue,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_104" n="85"/>I succeeded
            in discovering the cause of generation <app id="var568"><lem>and life; nay,</lem></app> more, I <app id="var569"><lem>became</lem></app> myself capable of
            bestowing animation upon lifeless <app id="var570"><lem>matter.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var571"><lem>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to
            delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at
            the summit of my desires, was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this
            discovery was so great and overwhelming, that all the steps</lem></app> by which I had been
            progressively led to it were <app id="var572"><lem>obliterated,</lem></app> and I <app id="var573"><lem>beheld</lem></app> only the result. What had been

            <app id="var617"><lem>but</lem></app> I doubted not that I should <app id="var618"><lem>ultimately</lem></app> succeed. I <app id="var619"><lem>prepared myself for a multitude of

            owe their <app id="var638"><lem>being</lem></app> to me. <app id="var639"><lem>No</lem></app> father could claim the gratitude of his child <app id="var640"><lem>so completely as
            I should deserve theirs. Pursuing</lem></app> these <app id="var641"><lem>reflections,</lem></app> I <app id="var642"><lem>thought,</lem></app> that if I could bestow
            <app id="var643"><lem>animation upon</lem></app> lifeless <app id="var644"><lem>matter,</lem></app> I might in process of time (although I now <app id="var645"><lem>found it

            person <app id="var652"><lem>had become emaciated with</lem></app> confinement. <app id="var653"><lem>Sometimes,</lem></app> on the very brink of <app id="var654"><lem>certainty,</lem></app>
            I <app id="var655"><lem>failed;</lem></app> yet <app id="var656"><lem>still I</lem></app> clung to the hope which the next day or the <app id="var657"><lem>next</lem></app> hour might
            realize. One secret which I alone <app id="var658"><lem>possessed</lem></app> was the hope to which I <app id="var659"><lem>had dedicated

            <app id="var662"><lem>eagerness,</lem></app> I pursued nature to her <app id="var663"><lem>hiding-places. Who</lem></app> shall <app id="var664"><lem>conceive</lem></app> the horrors of my
            secret <app id="var665"><lem>toil,</lem></app> as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured the

            seemed to <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_110" n="91"/>have lost all soul or sensation but for <app id="var675"><lem>this
            one</lem></app> pursuit. It was indeed <app id="var676"><lem>but a</lem></app> passing <app id="var677"><lem>trance,</lem></app> that only made me feel with <app id="var678"><lem>renewed
            acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my
            old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers,
            the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the
            top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and
            staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation: my eyeballs were starting from their
            sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the
            slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with
            loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually
            increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct60a"/><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_111" n="92"/>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged,
            heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
            bestow a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my
            eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me
            neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many
            miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted
            them; and I well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are pleased
            with yourself, you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from
            you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof
            that your other duties are equally neglected.”<anchor id="struct60b"/></p>

            which had taken an <app id="var684"><lem>irresistible</lem></app> hold of my <app id="var685"><lem>imagination.</lem></app> I <app id="var686"><lem>wished,</lem></app> as it <app id="var687"><lem>were,</lem></app> to
            <app id="var688"><lem>procrastinate</lem></app> all that related to my feelings of <app id="var689"><lem>affection until</lem></app> the great <app id="var690"><lem>object,</lem></app> which

            should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to
            preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never</lem></app> to <app id="var695"><lem>allow passion or a transitory desire to
            disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception

            has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple
            pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful,
            that is to say, not befitting the</lem></app> human mind. If this <app id="var696"><lem>rule were always</lem></app> observed; if no

          <p>My father made no reproach in his letters, and only took notice of my silence by
            inquiring into my occupations <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_114" n="95"/>more particularly than
            before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch
            the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme
            delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered
            before my work drew near to a close; and now every day showed me more plainly how well I
            had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like
            one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than an
            artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow
            fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; a disease that I regretted the
            more because I had hitherto enjoyed most excellent health, and had always boasted <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_115" n="96"/>of the firmness of my nerves. But I believed that
            exercise and amusement would soon drive away such symptoms; and I promised myself both
            of these when my creation should be complete. </p>

          <p><app id="var711"><lem>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi></lem></app> was on a dreary night of <app id="var712"><lem>November,</lem></app> that I beheld the
            <app id="var713"><lem>accomplishment of</lem></app> my <app id="var714"><lem>toils. With</lem></app> an anxiety that almost <app id="var715"><lem>amounted</lem></app> to <app id="var716"><lem>agony,</lem></app> I collected
            <app id="var717"><lem>the instruments</lem></app> of life around <app id="var718"><lem>me,</lem></app> that I might <app id="var719"><lem>infuse</lem></app> a spark of being into the
            lifeless <app id="var720"><lem>thing</lem></app> that lay at my feet. It was already one in the <app id="var721"><lem>morning;</lem></app> the rain pattered
            dismally against the <app id="var722"><lem>panes, and</lem></app> my candle was nearly burnt out, <app id="var723"><lem>when,</lem></app> by the glimmer of
            the <app id="var724"><lem>half-extinguished light,</lem></app> I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature <app id="var725"><lem>open; it</lem></app> breathed
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_117" n="98"/>hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its
            <app id="var726"><lem>limbs.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct67a"/>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom
            with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in
            proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His
            yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a
            lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only
            formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same
            colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and
            straight black lips.<anchor id="struct67b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var727"><lem>The</lem></app> different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of <app id="var728"><lem>human</lem></app> nature.
            I had worked hard for <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_118" n="99"/>nearly two <app id="var729"><lem>years,</lem></app> for the sole
            purpose of infusing <app id="var730"><lem>life</lem></app> into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest
            and <app id="var731"><lem>health.</lem></app> I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I
            had <app id="var732"><lem>finished, the beauty of the dream vanished,</lem></app> and breathless horror and disgust filled
            my heart. Unable <app id="var733"><lem>to</lem></app> endure the aspect of the <app id="var734"><lem>being</lem></app> I had created, I rushed out of the
            <app id="var735"><lem>room,</lem></app> and <app id="var736"><lem>continued</lem></app> a long time traversing my <app id="var737"><lem>bed-chamber,</lem></app> unable to compose my mind to
            sleep. At <app id="var738"><lem>length lassitude</lem></app> succeeded to the tumult I had before <app id="var739"><lem>endured;</lem></app> and I threw
            myself on <app id="var740"><lem>the</lem></app> bed in my <app id="var741"><lem>clothes,</lem></app> endeavouring to seek a <app id="var742"><lem>few</lem></app> moments of <app id="var743"><lem>forgetfulness.</lem></app>
            But it was in <app id="var744"><lem>vain:</lem></app> I slept <app id="var745"><lem>indeed,</lem></app> but I was disturbed by the wildest <app id="var746"><lem>dreams.</lem></app> I <app id="var747"><lem>thought
            I saw Elizabeth,</lem></app> in the bloom of <app id="var748"><lem>health,</lem></app> walking in the streets of <app id="var749"><lem>Ingolstadt. Delighted
            and surprised,</lem></app> I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_119" n="100"/>embraced <app id="var750"><lem>her;</lem></app> but as I imprinted the
            first kiss on her <app id="var751"><lem>lips,</lem></app> they became <app id="var752"><lem>livid</lem></app> with the hue of death; her features <app id="var753"><lem>appeared
            to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud
            enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I
            started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered,
            and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it
            forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster
            whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be
            called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds,
            while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was
            stretched <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_120" n="101"/>out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped,
            and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard belonging to the house which I
            inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the
            greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were
            to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given
            life.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct69a"/>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with
            animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished;
            he was ugly then; but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it
            became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>
          <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_121" n="102"/>hardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at
            others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with
            this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and
            pleasant rest for so long a space, were now become a hell to me; and the change was so
            rapid, the overthrow so complete!<anchor id="struct69b"/></p>

            hour. The porter opened the gates of the <app id="var761"><lem>court,</lem></app> which had that night been my <app id="var762"><lem>asylum,</lem></app> and
            I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick <app id="var763"><lem>steps,</lem></app> as if I <app id="var764"><lem>sought</lem></app> to <app id="var765"><lem>avoid the</lem></app>
            wretch whom I feared every <app id="var766"><lem>turning of</lem></app> the street would present <app id="var767"><lem>to my view. I did not

          <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily exercise, to
            ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets, without any clear
            conception of where I was, or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of
            fear; and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:</p>

          <p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_123" n="104"/>diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I
            paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that
            was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer, I observed
            that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just where I was standing; and, on the door
            being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. “My
            dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you! how fortunate that you
            should be here at the very moment of my alighting!”<anchor id="struct72b"/></p>

            in a few words. <app id="var971"><lem>Madame Moritz,</lem></app> her <app id="var972"><lem>mother,</lem></app> was a widow with four <app id="var973"><lem>children,</lem></app> of whom
            <app id="var974"><lem>Justine</lem></app> was the third. This girl had always been the <app id="var975"><lem>favourite</lem></app> of her <app id="var976"><lem>father; but,
            through a strange perversity,</lem></app> her <app id="var977"><lem>mother</lem></app> could <app id="var978"><lem>not</lem></app> endure <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_137" n="117"/><app id="var979"><lem>her, and,</lem></app> after the death of M. <app id="var980"><lem>Moritz,</lem></app> treated her very ill.

            allow her to live at <app id="var984"><lem>her house. The republican institutions of our country have produced
            simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies</lem></app> that
            <app id="var985"><lem>surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its
            inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners
            are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a
            servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties

            a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor <app id="var1039"><lem>woman</lem></app> was very vacillating in her repentance.
            She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her <app id="var1040"><lem>unkindness, but much oftener accused her of
            having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw
            Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now
            at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_141" n="122"/>the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned
            to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and

            greatly fatigued me; <app id="var1067"><lem>but</lem></app> my convalescence <app id="var1068"><lem>had commenced,</lem></app> and <app id="var1069"><lem>proceeded regularly. In</lem></app>
            another fortnight I was able to leave my <app id="var1070"><lem>chamber.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct98a"/> <anchor id="struct98b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1071"><lem>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several
            professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill
            befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_144" n="125"/>night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my
            misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.
            When I was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would
            renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my
            apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had
            acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares
            of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted
            torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made
            in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the
            real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and</lem></app> changed the subject from my im<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_145" n="126"/>provement, to the science itself, with <app id="var1072"><lem>a desire,</lem></app> as I
            evidently <app id="var1073"><lem>saw,</lem></app> of drawing <app id="var1074"><lem>me</lem></app> out. <app id="var1075"><lem>What</lem></app> could I do? He meant to <app id="var1076"><lem>please,</lem></app> and <app id="var1077"><lem>he tormented
            me.</lem></app> I felt as if he had <app id="var1078"><lem>placed carefully,</lem></app> one by <app id="var1079"><lem>one,</lem></app> in my view those instruments which
            were <app id="var1080"><lem>to be afterwards</lem></app> used in putting me to a slow and cruel <app id="var1081"><lem>death.</lem></app> I writhed under his
            words, yet dared not <app id="var1082"><lem>exhibit</lem></app> the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were
            always quick in discerning the sensations of <app id="var1083"><lem>others,</lem></app> declined the <app id="var1084"><lem>subject, alleging,</lem></app> in
            <app id="var1085"><lem>excuse,</lem></app> his <app id="var1086"><lem>total ignorance; and</lem></app> the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked <app id="var1087"><lem>my
            friend</lem></app> from my heart, but I did not speak. I <app id="var1088"><lem>saw plainly</lem></app> that he was surprised, but he
            never attempted to draw my secret from <app id="var1089"><lem>me;</lem></app> and although I loved him with a mixture of
            <app id="var1090"><lem>affection</lem></app> and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never <app id="var1091"><lem>persuade</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_146" n="127"/>myself to confide to him that event which was so often

            creature <app id="var1193"><lem>who,</lem></app> a few years ago, loving <app id="var1194"><lem>and</lem></app> beloved by all, had no sorrow or <app id="var1195"><lem>care.</lem></app> <app id="var1196"><lem>When

            on me the most delightful sensations.</lem></app> A serene sky <app id="var1198"><lem>and verdant</lem></app> fields filled me with
            <app id="var1199"><lem>ecstasy. The</lem></app> present season was indeed <app id="var1200"><lem>divine;</lem></app> the flowers of spring <app id="var1201"><lem>bloomed</lem></app> in the

            during the <app id="var1207"><lem>preceding</lem></app> year <app id="var1208"><lem>had pressed</lem></app> upon <app id="var1209"><lem>me, notwithstanding</lem></app> my endeavours to throw

          <p><app id="var1212"><lem>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathized in my feelings: he exerted
            himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations</lem></app> that <app id="var1213"><lem>filled</lem></app> his <app id="var1214"><lem>soul.</lem></app> The
            resources of his mind on this occasion were truly <app id="var1215"><lem>astonishing:</lem></app> his conversation was full
            of <app id="var1216"><lem>imagination;</lem></app> and very often, in imitation of the <app id="var1217"><lem>Persian and</lem></app> Arabic writers, he

            and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I
            discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in
            health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer’s finger
            was on his neck.</p>
          <p>“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the
            secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to
            prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the

          <p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe
            the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first expressed on receiving news from my
            friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.</p>
          <p>“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness,
            “are you always to be <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_159" n="140"/>unhappy? My dear friend, what

          <p>I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the
            extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account
            of my misfortune.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct120a"/>“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable.

            topics of <app id="var1307"><lem>consolation, but</lem></app> by <app id="var1308"><lem>exhibiting</lem></app> the truest sympathy. “Poor <app id="var1309"><lem>William!”</lem></app> said <app id="var1310"><lem>he,

          <p><anchor id="struct123a"/>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on
            my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses

          <p><app id="var1328"><lem>My</lem></app> journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry <app id="var1329"><lem>on,</lem></app> for I longed to console

            but when I drew near my <app id="var1333"><lem>native town,</lem></app> I <app id="var1334"><lem>slackened my progress.</lem></app> I could hardly sustain the
            multitude of feelings that <app id="var1335"><lem>crowded</lem></app> into my mind. I passed <app id="var1336"><lem>through</lem></app> scenes familiar to my
            <app id="var1337"><lem>youth,</lem></app> but which I had not seen for nearly <app id="var1338"><lem>six years. How</lem></app> altered every thing might be

            little <app id="var1341"><lem>circumstances</lem></app> might have <app id="var1342"><lem>by degrees worked other alterations, which,</lem></app> although

          <p><anchor id="struct124a"/>I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the
            lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm, and the snowy <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_162" n="143"/>mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed.
            By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards

          <p><app id="var1384"><lem>It was completely dark</lem></app> when I arrived <app id="var1385"><lem>in the environs of Geneva;</lem></app> the gates of <app id="var1386"><lem>the town</lem></app>
            were already <app id="var1387"><lem>shut;</lem></app> and I <app id="var1388"><lem>was obliged</lem></app> to <app id="var1389"><lem>pass the</lem></app> night at <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_164" n="145"/><app id="var1390"><lem>Secheron, a village half a league to the east of the city. The</lem></app> sky was
            <app id="var1391"><lem>serene; and,</lem></app> as I was unable to <app id="var1392"><lem>rest,</lem></app> I resolved to <app id="var1393"><lem>visit</lem></app> the spot where <app id="var1394"><lem>my</lem></app> poor William
            had been <app id="var1395"><lem>murdered. As</lem></app> I <app id="var1396"><lem>could not pass through the town,</lem></app> I <app id="var1397"><lem>was obliged to cross the lake
            in</lem></app> a <app id="var1398"><lem>boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings
            playing</lem></app> on the <app id="var1399"><lem>summit</lem></app> of <app id="var1400"><lem>Mont Blanc</lem></app> in the most beautiful <app id="var1401"><lem>figures. The storm appeared to
            approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended</lem></app> a <app id="var1402"><lem>low hill,</lem></app> that I might observe <app id="var1403"><lem>its</lem></app>
            progress. It <app id="var1404"><lem>advanced; the heavens were clouded,</lem></app> and I soon felt the rain coming slowly
            in large <app id="var1405"><lem>drops,</lem></app> but its violence quickly <app id="var1406"><lem>increased.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct129a"/>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every
            minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from
            Salêve, the Juras, <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_165" n="146"/>and the Alps of Savoy; vivid
            flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a
            vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until
            the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in
            Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm
            hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the
            promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with
            faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain
            to the east of the lake.<anchor id="struct129b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct130a"/> <anchor id="struct130b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1407"><lem>While</lem></app> I watched the <app id="var1408"><lem>storm,</lem></app> so <app id="var1409"><lem>beautiful</lem></app> yet <app id="var1410"><lem>terrific,</lem></app> I wandered <app id="var1411"><lem>on</lem></app> with a hasty <app id="var1412"><lem>step.
            This</lem></app> noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my <app id="var1413"><lem>hands, and exclaimed aloud,</lem></app>
            “William, dear <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_166" n="147"/><app id="var1414"><lem>angel!</lem></app> this is thy funeral, this thy
            dirge!” As I said these <app id="var1415"><lem>words, I</lem></app> perceived in the gloom <app id="var1416"><lem>a</lem></app> figure which stole from behind
            a clump of trees near <app id="var1417"><lem>me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A
            flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered</lem></app> its <app id="var1418"><lem>shape plainly to me; its
            gigantic stature, and</lem></app> the deformity of its <app id="var1419"><lem>aspect, more</lem></app> hideous <app id="var1420"><lem>than belongs to
            humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy dæmon to whom I had
            given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer
            of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of
            its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against</lem></app> a <app id="var1421"><lem>tree for support. The
            figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_167" n="148"/>shape could have destroyed that fair child. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was the murderer! I</lem></app> could <app id="var1422"><lem>not doubt it. The mere presence of the
            idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it
            would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks
            of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
            south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var1423"><lem>I</lem></app> remained <app id="var1424"><lem>motionless. The</lem></app> thunder <app id="var1425"><lem>ceased;</lem></app> but the rain still <app id="var1426"><lem>continued, and</lem></app> the scene

          <p><anchor id="struct132a"/>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I
            spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the
            weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being
            whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of
            horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire,
            my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to
            me.<anchor id="struct132b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1447"><lem>Day dawned;</lem></app> and I directed my steps <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_169" n="150"/>towards the
            <app id="var1448"><lem>town.</lem></app> <app id="var1449"><lem>The</lem></app> gates were <app id="var1450"><lem>open,</lem></app> and I hastened to my <app id="var1451"><lem>father’s house. My</lem></app> first thought was to
            <app id="var1452"><lem>discover</lem></app> what I knew of the <app id="var1453"><lem>murderer, and</lem></app> cause instant <app id="var1454"><lem>pursuit</lem></app> to be made. But I paused
            when I <app id="var1455"><lem>reflected on</lem></app> the story <app id="var1456"><lem>that</lem></app> I had to tell. A <app id="var1457"><lem>being</lem></app> whom I myself had <app id="var1458"><lem>formed,</lem></app> and
            endued with life, <app id="var1459"><lem>had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible
            mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the
            time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale
            otherwise so</lem></app> utterly <app id="var1460"><lem>improbable. I</lem></app> well <app id="var1461"><lem>knew that</lem></app> if any other had <app id="var1462"><lem>communicated</lem></app> such a
            <app id="var1463"><lem>relation</lem></app> to <app id="var1464"><lem>me,</lem></app> I should have looked upon it as the ravings of <app id="var1465"><lem>insanity. Besides,</lem></app> the
            strange nature of the animal would elude all <app id="var1466"><lem>pursuit,</lem></app> even if I were so far <app id="var1467"><lem>credited as</lem></app>
            to persuade <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_170" n="151"/><app id="var1468"><lem>my</lem></app> relatives to commence <app id="var1469"><lem>it. Besides, of
            what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
            overhanging sides of Mount Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to
            remain silent.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct135a"/>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I told the servants
            not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of

          <p><app id="var1470"><lem>Six</lem></app> years had <app id="var1471"><lem>elapsed, passed</lem></app> as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in

            Beloved and respectable parent! <app id="var1472"><lem>He</lem></app> still remained to me. I gazed on <app id="var1473"><lem>the</lem></app> picture of my
            <app id="var1474"><lem>mother,</lem></app> which stood over the <app id="var1475"><lem>mantelpiece.</lem></app> It was an historical <app id="var1476"><lem>subject,</lem></app> painted <app id="var1477"><lem>at my
            father’s desire,</lem></app> and re<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_171" n="152"/>presented Caroline <app id="var1478"><lem>Beaufort</lem></app> in
            an agony of <app id="var1479"><lem>despair,</lem></app> kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, <app id="var1480"><lem>and</lem></app>
            her cheek <app id="var1481"><lem>pale;</lem></app> but there was an air of dignity and <app id="var1482"><lem>beauty,</lem></app> that hardly <app id="var1483"><lem>permitted</lem></app> the
            <app id="var1484"><lem>sentiment</lem></app> of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of <app id="var1485"><lem>William;</lem></app> and my tears flowed
            when I looked upon <app id="var1486"><lem>it. While</lem></app> I was thus <app id="var1487"><lem>engaged,</lem></app> Ernest <app id="var1488"><lem>entered:</lem></app> he had heard me <app id="var1489"><lem>arrive,</lem></app>
            and hastened to welcome me. He expressed <app id="var1490"><lem>a sorrowful</lem></app> delight <app id="var1491"><lem>to see me: “Welcome, my
            dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would
            have found us all joyous and delighted. But we are now unhappy; and, I am afraid, tears
            instead of smiles will be your welcome. Our father looks so sorrowful: this dreadful
            event seems to have revived in his mind his grief on the death of mamma. Poor <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_172" n="153"/>Elizabeth, also, is quite inconsolable.” Ernest began
            to weep as he said these words.</lem></app></p>

            miserable the moment I enter my father’s house after so long an absence. <app id="var1496"><lem>But,</lem></app> tell me,

          <p><anchor id="struct138a"/>“She indeed requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my

          <p>“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him?
            It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a

          <p><app id="var1501"><lem>He related that,</lem></app> the <app id="var1502"><lem>morning on which the murder of poor William had been <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_174" n="155"/>discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to

            she had worn on the night of the <app id="var1503"><lem>murder, had</lem></app> discovered in her pocket the picture of my
            <app id="var1504"><lem>mother,</lem></app> which had been judged to be the <app id="var1505"><lem>temptation</lem></app> of the murderer. The servant
            instantly <app id="var1506"><lem>showed</lem></app> it to one of the others, <app id="var1507"><lem>who,</lem></app> without saying a word to any of the
            <app id="var1508"><lem>family,</lem></app> went to a <app id="var1509"><lem>magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On</lem></app>
            being charged with the <app id="var1510"><lem>fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by
            her extreme confusion of manner.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct142a"/>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You
            are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.”</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_175" n="156"/>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness
            deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
            after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic
            than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, papa! Victor says that
            he knows who was the murderer of poor William.”</p>
          <p>“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather have been for
            ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so
            highly.”</p>
          <p>“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”</p>
          <p>“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried to-day, and
            I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.” <anchor id="struct142b"/></p>

          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_176" n="157"/>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my
            own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had
            no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong
            enough to convict her; and, in this assurance, I calmed myself, expecting the trial with
            eagerness, but without prognosticating an evil result.</p>

          <p><app id="var1549"><lem>W<hi rend="smallcaps">E</hi> passed a few sad hours, until eleven o’clock, when the
            trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as
            witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of
            justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether the result of my
            curiosity and lawless devices would cause the</lem></app> death of two of my <app id="var1550"><lem>fellow-beings: one</lem></app> a
            smiling <app id="var1551"><lem>babe,</lem></app> full of innocence and <app id="var1552"><lem>joy;</lem></app> the other far more dreadfully <app id="var1553"><lem>murdered,</lem></app> with

            murder <app id="var1556"><lem>memorable</lem></app> in horror. Justine also was a girl of <app id="var1557"><lem>merit,</lem></app> and possessed qualities
            which promised to render her <app id="var1558"><lem>life happy:</lem></app> now all was to be <app id="var1559"><lem>obliterated</lem></app> in <app id="var1560"><lem>an</lem></app> ignominious
            <app id="var1561"><lem>grave;</lem></app> <app id="var1562"><lem>and</lem></app> I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of
            the crime ascribed to <app id="var1563"><lem>Justine;</lem></app> but I was absent when it was <app id="var1564"><lem>committed,</lem></app> and such a
            declaration would <app id="var1565"><lem>have been</lem></app> considered as the ravings of a <app id="var1566"><lem>madman,</lem></app> and <app id="var1567"><lem>would</lem></app> not have
            <app id="var1568"><lem>exculpated</lem></app> her who suffered through <app id="var1569"><lem>me.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct149a"/>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance,
            always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
            Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and
            execrated by thousands; for all the <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_181" n="161"/>kindness which
            her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators
            by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil,
            yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been
            adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
            When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we
            were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered
            herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.<anchor id="struct149b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var1570"><lem>The</lem></app> trial <app id="var1571"><lem>began; and,</lem></app> after the advocate against her had stated the <app id="var1572"><lem>charge,</lem></app> several
            witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against <app id="var1573"><lem>her,</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_182" n="163"/>which <app id="var1574"><lem>might</lem></app> have staggered any one who had not such
            <app id="var1575"><lem>proof</lem></app> of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the
            <app id="var1576"><lem>murder</lem></app> had been <app id="var1577"><lem>committed,</lem></app> and towards morning had been perceived by a <app id="var1578"><lem>market-woman</lem></app> not
            far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. <app id="var1579"><lem>The</lem></app>
            woman asked <app id="var1580"><lem>her</lem></app> what she did <app id="var1581"><lem>there;</lem></app> but she looked very <app id="var1582"><lem>strangely,</lem></app> and only returned a
            confused <app id="var1583"><lem>and unintelligible answer. She</lem></app> returned to the house about eight <app id="var1584"><lem>o’clock; and,</lem></app>
            when <app id="var1585"><lem>one inquired</lem></app> where she had passed the <app id="var1586"><lem>night,</lem></app> she replied that she had been looking
            <app id="var1587"><lem>for</lem></app> the <app id="var1588"><lem>child,</lem></app> and <app id="var1589"><lem>demanded</lem></app> earnestly if any thing had been heard <app id="var1590"><lem>concerning</lem></app> him. When
            <app id="var1591"><lem>shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days. The
            picture</lem></app> was <app id="var1592"><lem>then produced, which the servant had found in her <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_183" n="164"/>pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
            which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur
            of horror and indignation filled the court.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct151a"/>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had
            altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled
            with her tears; but, when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke
            in an audible, although variable, voice:—<anchor id="struct151b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct152a"/> <anchor id="struct152b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var1593"><lem>“God</lem></app> knows,” she said, <app id="var1594"><lem>“how</lem></app> entirely I am <app id="var1595"><lem>innocent. But</lem></app> I do not pretend <app id="var1596"><lem>that</lem></app> my
            protestations <app id="var1597"><lem>should acquit me: I</lem></app> rest my innocence <app id="var1598"><lem>on</lem></app> a <app id="var1599"><lem>plain and simple</lem></app> explanation of

          <p><anchor id="struct153a"/> <anchor id="struct153b"/></p>
          <p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of
            the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a
            village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock,
            she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She
            was alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates
            of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn
            belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
            known. Unable to rest or sleep, she quitted her asylum early, that she might again
            endeavour to find my <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_185" n="166"/>brother. If she had gone near
            the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered
            when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless
            night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could
            give no account.</p>

            Did the murderer place it there? I know of <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_186" n="167"/>no
            opportunity afforded him for so <app id="var1620"><lem>doing; or,</lem></app> if I <app id="var1621"><lem>had,</lem></app> why should he have stolen the

          <p><anchor id="struct155a"/>“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg

          <p>Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of
            her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them
            timorous, and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her
            excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when,
            although violently agi<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_187" n="168"/>tated, she desired permission

          <p><anchor id="struct162a"/>We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the
            further end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on
            seeing us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of
            Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Justine!” said she, why did you rob me of my last consolation. I relied on your
            innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am
            now.”</p>
          <p>“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_193" n="174"/>join with my enemies to crush me?” Her voice was
            suffocated with sobs.</p>
          <p>“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not
            one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I
            heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
            assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but

          <p><anchor id="struct171a"/>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter

          <p>N<hi rend="smallcaps">OTHING</hi> is more painful to the human mind, than, after the

            Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a
            weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep
            fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_202" n="183"/>beyond description horrible, and more, much more,
            (I persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and the love
            of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment when
            I should put them in practice, and make myself useful to my fellow-beings. Now all was
            blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the
            past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was
            seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense
            tortures, such as no language can describe.</p>
          <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered from the first
            shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was
            torture to <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_203" n="184"/>me; solitude was my only consolation—deep,
            dark, death-like solitude.<anchor id="struct173b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct176a"/>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the

            remorse had not mingled its bitterness with my other sensations. Now I could only answer

            within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now <app id="var1877"><lem>free. Often,</lem></app> after the rest of
            the family had retired for the <app id="var1878"><lem>night,</lem></app> I took the <app id="var1879"><lem>boat,</lem></app> and passed <app id="var1880"><lem>many hours</lem></app> upon the

            <app id="var1885"><lem>rowing</lem></app> into the middle of the <app id="var1886"><lem>lake,</lem></app> I left the boat to <app id="var1887"><lem>pursue</lem></app> its own <app id="var1888"><lem>course,</lem></app> and <app id="var1889"><lem>gave
            way</lem></app> to my own miserable reflections. I was often <app id="var1890"><lem>tempted,</lem></app> when <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_205" n="186"/>all was <app id="var1891"><lem>at</lem></app> peace around <app id="var1892"><lem>me,</lem></app> and I the only unquiet thing that wandered

            harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say,
            I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my
            calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering
            Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought
            also of my father, and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave them
            exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct178a"/>At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that
            I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_206" n="187"/>could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of
            unalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should
            perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that
            he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the
            recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear, so long as any thing I loved
            remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him,
            I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that
            life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice,
            my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to
            the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_207" n="188"/>there,
            have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the
            utmost extent of anger on his head, and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.<anchor id="struct178b"/></p>

            of <app id="var1967"><lem>Chamounix.</lem></app> I had been there <app id="var1968"><lem>before,</lem></app> but Elizabeth <app id="var1969"><lem>and</lem></app> Ernest never <app id="var1970"><lem>had;</lem></app> and both had

            described to them as so wonderful <app id="var1973"><lem>and</lem></app> sublime. Accordingly we departed from Geneva on
            this tour about the middle of the month of <app id="var1974"><lem>August,</lem></app> nearly two months after the death of

          <p><app id="var1976"><lem>The weather</lem></app> was <app id="var1977"><lem>uncommonly fine;</lem></app> and <app id="var1978"><lem>if mine had been a sorrow to be chased away by any

            <app id="var1979"><lem>scene; it</lem></app> sometimes <app id="var1980"><lem>lulled, although it</lem></app> could not extinguish my grief. <app id="var1981"><lem>During the</lem></app> first
            day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the mountains at a <app id="var1982"><lem>distance,
            towards</lem></app> which we gradually advanced. <app id="var1983"><lem>We</lem></app> perceived that the valley through which we
            wound, and which was formed by the <app id="var1984"><lem>river Arve,</lem></app> whose course we followed, closed <app id="var1985"><lem>in upon</lem></app>
            us by <app id="var1986"><lem>degrees;</lem></app> and when the sun had <app id="var1987"><lem>set,</lem></app> we <app id="var1988"><lem>beheld</lem></app> immense mountains <app id="var1989"><lem>and precipices</lem></app>
            overhanging us on <app id="var1990"><lem>every side, and</lem></app> heard the sound of <app id="var1991"><lem>the</lem></app> river raging <app id="var1992"><lem>among</lem></app> rocks, and
            the dashing of <app id="var1993"><lem>water-falls around.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct184a"/>The next day we pursued our journey upon mules; and as we ascended still higher, the
            valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on
            the precipices <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_213" n="194"/>of piny mountains; the impetuous Arve,
            and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees, formed a scene of
            singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose
            white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth,
            the habitations of another race of beings.<anchor id="struct184b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct185a"/> <anchor id="struct185b"/></p>
          <p>We passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened
            before us, and we began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after we entered
            the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful
            and picturesque as that of Servox, through which we had just passed. The high and snowy
            mountains were its immediate boundaries; but we saw no more ruined castles and fertile
            fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_214" n="195"/>we
            heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avelânche, and marked the smoke of its
            passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the
            surrounding <hi rend="italic">aiguilles</hi>, and its tremendous <hi rend="italic">dome</hi> overlooked the valley.</p>

          <p><app id="var1994"><lem>During this journey, I sometimes joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself to point out to
            her the various beauties of the scene. I often suffered my mule to lag behind, and
            indulged in the misery of reflection. At other times I spurred on</lem></app> the animal before my
            <app id="var1995"><lem>companions,</lem></app> that I might forget them, the world, <app id="var1996"><lem>and,</lem></app> more than <app id="var1997"><lem>all,</lem></app> myself. When at a
            <app id="var1998"><lem>distance,</lem></app> I <app id="var1999"><lem>alighted,</lem></app> and threw myself on the <app id="var2000"><lem>grass,</lem></app> weighed down by horror <app id="var2001"><lem>and</lem></app> despair.
            At eight in the evening <app id="var2002"><lem>I</lem></app> arrived at <app id="var2003"><lem>Chamounix.</lem></app> My father <app id="var2004"><lem>and</lem></app> Elizabeth were very much
            <app id="var2005"><lem>fatigued; Ernest,</lem></app> who accompanied <app id="var2006"><lem>us,</lem></app> was <app id="var2007"><lem>de<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_215" n="195"/>lighted,</lem></app>
            and in high <app id="var2008"><lem>spirits; the</lem></app> only circumstance that detracted from his pleasure was the
            south <app id="var2009"><lem>wind,</lem></app> and the rain <app id="var2010"><lem>it</lem></app> seemed to promise <app id="var2011"><lem>for</lem></app> the next day.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct187a"/>We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not. I remained
            many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning that played above Mont Blanc,
            and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which ran below my window.</p>

          <p><app id="var2042"><lem>The following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits
            of the mountains. I rose early, but felt unusually melancholy. The rain depressed me; my
            old feelings recurred, and I was miserable. I knew how disappointed my father would be
            at this sudden change, and I wished to avoid him until I had recovered myself so far as
            to be enabled to conceal those feelings that overpowered me. I knew that they would
            remain that day at the inn; <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_218" n="199"/>and as I had ever</lem></app> inured

            I remembered the effect <app id="var2048"><lem>that the</lem></app> view of the tremendous and <app id="var2049"><lem>ever-moving</lem></app> glacier had
            <app id="var2050"><lem>produced</lem></app> upon my mind when I first saw <app id="var2051"><lem>it. It</lem></app> had then filled me with a sublime <app id="var2052"><lem>ecstacy</lem></app>
            that gave wings to the <app id="var2053"><lem>soul,</lem></app> and allowed <app id="var2054"><lem>it</lem></app> to soar from the <app id="var2055"><lem>obscure</lem></app> world to light <app id="var2056"><lem>and</lem></app>
            joy. The sight of the awful <app id="var2057"><lem>and</lem></app> majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of
            <app id="var2058"><lem>solemnizing my mind, and</lem></app> causing me to forget <app id="var2059"><lem>the</lem></app> passing cares of life. I determined to

          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v1_221" n="202"/>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the
            ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
            both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I
            descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a
            troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice
            is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite
            mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was
            exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful
            majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous
            scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_222" n="203"/>whose aërial summits hung over its recesses. Their
            icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was
            before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed—“Wandering spirits,
            if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness,
            or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct193a"/>As I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing
            towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I
            had walked with caution; his stature also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of
            man. I was troubled: a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I
            was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came
            nearer, (sight tre<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_223" n="204"/>mendous and abhorred!) that it was
            the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his
            approach, and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance
            bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly
            ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this;
            anger and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to
            overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.<anchor id="struct193b"/></p>

          <p>“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original æra of my being: all
            the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of
            sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at the same time; and it was,
            indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various
            senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was
            obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but hardly had I
            felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_233" n="214"/>poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I believe,
            descended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and
            opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I
            could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or
            avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I
            walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near
            Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt
            tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate
            some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my
            thirst at the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.</p>

          <p><anchor id="struct213a"/>“Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a

            place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced
            would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of
            the fire which I had obtained through accident, and knew not how to re-produce <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_240" n="221"/>it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration
            of this difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it; and,
            wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I
            passed three days in these rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A great
            fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white;
            the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance
            that covered the ground.<anchor id="struct213b"/></p>

            exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their
            sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s
            breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did
            not like. Then, overcome by fatigue, I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_242" n="223"/>lay down among

            the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance;
            but, after my late dearly-bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge
            was constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No
            wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
            although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from

            occupied a <app id="var2461"><lem>part</lem></app> of <app id="var2462"><lem>it,</lem></app> but the panes had <app id="var2463"><lem>been</lem></app> filled up with wood. In one of these was a

            Through</lem></app> this <app id="var2468"><lem>crevice</lem></app> a small room was visible, whitewashed <app id="var2469"><lem>and clean,</lem></app> but very bare of
            <app id="var2470"><lem>furniture. In</lem></app> one <app id="var2471"><lem>corner,</lem></app> near a small <app id="var2472"><lem>fire, sat</lem></app> an old <app id="var2473"><lem>man,</lem></app> leaning his head on his

            down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play, and to pro<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_248" n="229"/>duce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
            nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld aught
            beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my
            reverence, while the gentle manners</lem></app> of the <app id="var2479"><lem>girl enticed my love. He played a sweet
            mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
            which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few
            sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and
            smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and
            overpowering nature: they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never
            before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_249" n="230"/>withdrew from</lem></app> the <app id="var2480"><lem>window, unable to bear these

          <p>“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The
            girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and, taking some of the
            fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a
            nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed
            pleased, and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water,
            and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went
            into the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he
            had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him, and they entered the
            cottage together. </p>

            setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human
            neighbours. In the evening, the young girl and her companion were employed in various
            occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument
            which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had
            finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and
            neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument or the songs of the birds: I

            and Agatha.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct235a"/>“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I discovered that he
            uttered many of the same sounds when he read, as when he talked. I conjectured,
            therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I
            ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible, when I did not even
            understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in
            this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_263" n="244"/>conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily
            perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought
            not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which
            knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with
            this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>
          <p>“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate
            complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At
            first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the
            mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I
            was filled with the bitterest sen<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_264" n="245"/>sations of
            despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of
            this miserable deformity.</p>
          <p>“As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld
            the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more employed: and the
            heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards
            found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several
            new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of
            comfort increased daily as the season advanced.</p>
          <p>“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I
            found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_265" n="246"/>This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly
            dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.</p>
          <p>“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of
            the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the
            remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest,
            if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected
            my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I
            cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by
            Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly
            astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_266" n="246"/>occasions, utter the words <hi rend="italic">good spirit</hi>, <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi>; but I did not then understand the signification of these
            terms.</p>
          <p>“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings
            of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable,
            and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore
            happiness to these deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the
            venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix, flitted before me. I
            looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I
            formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their
            reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour
            and conciliating <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_267" n="248"/>words, I should first win their
            favour, and afterwards their love.</p>
          <p>“These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring
            the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was
            very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood
            with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass, whose
            intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment
            than blows and execration.</p>
          <p>“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the
            earth. Men, who bfore<comment text="ebb: printer error"/> this change seemed to have been hid in caves, dispersed
            themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more
              cheer<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_268" n="249"/>ful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth
            on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time
            before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting
            appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and
            the future gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.”<anchor id="struct235b"/></p>

          <p>I <hi rend="smallcaps">NOW</hi> hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall
            relate events, that impressed me with feelings which, From what I had been, have made me
            what I am.</p>
          <p>“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies cloudless. It
            surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most
            beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand
            scents of delight, vand a thousand sights of beauty.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_275" n="2"/>“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers
            periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children
            listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond
            expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music, and I
            conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied
            in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music, when some one tapped
            at the door.</p>
          <p>“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was
            dressed in a dark suit, an covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to
            which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.
            Her voice was musical, but unlike that of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_276" n="3"/>either of my
            friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him,
            threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair
            of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle,
            although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously
            fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.</p>
          <p>“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished
            from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could
            hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure;
            and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by
            different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_277" n="4"/>she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as
            well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him,
            but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into
            the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young
            stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her,
            and embraced her affectionately.<comment text=" RM: edit to here 05/03/2017 "/></p>
          <p>“I soon perceived, that althoug the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to
            have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, nor herself understood, the
            cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her presence
            diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
            morning mists. Felix seeme <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_278" n="5"/>peculiarly happy, and with
            smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands
            . of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me
            to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they,
            by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently
            I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after
            them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred
            to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger
            learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them, indeed, were those which I
            had before understood, but I profited by the others.</p>
          <p>“As night came on, Agatha and the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_279" n="6"/>Arabian retired
            early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good
            night, sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the
            frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject
            of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty
            towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>
          <p>“The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of
            Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his
            guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of
            sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence,
            swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_280" n="7"/>“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha,
            who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet
            accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared
            enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by
            which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by
            her music.</p>
          <p>“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration, that joy had
            taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and
            happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I
            began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>
          <p>“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_281" n="8"/>the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers,
            sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the
            sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme
            pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early
            rising of the sun; for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with
            the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.</p>
          <p>“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language;
            and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very
            little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost
            every word that was spoken.</p>
          <p>“While I improved in speech, I also <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_282" n="9"/>learned the
            science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide
            field for wonder and delight.</p>
          <p>“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s <hi rend="italic">Ruins of
              Empires</hi>. I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in
            reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because
            the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work
            I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the several empires at present
            existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and
            religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of
            the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful
            virtue of the early Romans—of <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_283" n="10"/>their subsequent
            degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.
            I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the
            hapless fate of its original inhabitants.</p>
          <p>“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once
            so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one
            time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at another as all that can be conceived of
            noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can
            befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared
            the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless
            worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his
            fellow, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_284" n="11"/>or even why there were laws and governments;
            but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with
            disgust and loathing.</p>
          <p>“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to
            the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human
            society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and
            squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>
          <p>“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most
            esteemed by your fellowcreatures were, high and unsullied descent united with riches. A
            man might be respected with only one of these advantages; but without either he was
            considered, except in very rare instances, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_285" n="12"/>as a
            vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profit of the chosen few? And
            what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I
            possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a
            figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was
            more agile than they, and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat
            and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked
            around, I saw and heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth,
            from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?</p>
          <p>“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried
            to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_286" n="13"/>I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor
            felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!</p>
          <p>“ Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized
            on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and
            feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain,
            and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and
            good feelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I
            was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by
            stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the
            desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_287" n="14"/>the animated smiles of the charming Arabian, were not
            for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the loved
            Felix, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>
          <p>“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of difference of sexes;
            of the birth and growth of children; how the father doated on the smiles of the infant,
            and the lively sallies of the older child; how all the life and cares of the mother were
            wrapped up in the precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge;
            of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to
            another in mutual bonds.</p>
          <p>“ But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no
            mother had blessed me <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_288" n="15"/>with smiles and caresses; or if
            they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished
            nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.
            I had never yet seen a being resembling me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What
            was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.</p>
          <p>“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to return to the
            cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and
            wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for
            so I loved, in an innocent, half painful self-deceit, to call them).</p>

            not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it a number of circumstances,
            each interesting, and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.</p>

            where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved
            by equals. His son was bred in the ser<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_290" n="17"/>vice of his
            country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months
            before my arrival, they had lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris,
            surrounded by friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of
            intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.<anchor id="struct239b"/></p>

            thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father,
            who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended
            services towards her parent; and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct244a"/>“I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in the hovel,
            to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix

            communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
            the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part

            of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited
            towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another
            through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and

            no <app id="var3255"><lem>motion;</lem></app> I cannot describe the agony <app id="var3256"><lem>of</lem></app> this suspense.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct293a"/>“Presently two countrymen passed by ; but, pausing near the cottage, they entered into
            conversation, using violent <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_330" n="57"/>gesticulations; but I did
            not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed
            from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man: I
            was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited
            anxiously to discover, from his discourse, the meaning of these unusual appearances.</p>
          <p>“‘Do you consider,‘ said his companion to him, ‘thatyou will be obliged to pay three
            months’ rent, and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair
            advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
            determination.‘<anchor id="struct293b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct294a"/> <anchor id="struct294b"/></p>
          <p>“‘It is utterly useless,‘ replied Felix, ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage. The
            life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dread<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_331" n="58"/>ful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover
            their horror. I entreat you not to reason'with me any more. Take possession of your
            tenement, and let me fly from this place.’</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct295a"/>“Felix trenibled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage,
            in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed I never saw any of the
            family of De Lacey more.</p>
          <p>“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid
            despair. My protectors had departed, and had broken the only link that held me to the
            world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did
            not strive to control them; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent
            my mind towards injury and death. <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_332" n="59"/>When I thought of my
            friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite
            beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.
            But again, when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a
            rage of anger; and, unable to injure any thing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate
            objects. As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and,
            after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced
            impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.<anchor id="struct295b"/></p>

            when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night,
            fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the
            sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_336" n="63"/>frozen; the surface of the earth was hard, and chill,
            and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! how often did I imprecate curses on the
            cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to
            gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I
            feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were
            hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a
            map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings
            allowed me no respite: no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not
            extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of
            Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again began to look
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_337" n="64"/>green, confirmed in an especial manner the

          <p><anchor id="struct302a"/>“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which
            was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches,
            now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to
            pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the
            shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the spot
            where I was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in sport. She continued her
            course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she
            fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place, aud, with extreme labour from
            the force of the current, saved her, and dragged her <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_339" n="66"/>to shore. She was senseless; and I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore
            animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably
            the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and,
            tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed
            speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he
            carried, at my body, and fired. I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with increased
            swiftness, escaped into the wood.<anchor id="struct302b"/></p>

            blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had
            manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a
            creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit
            among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would
            be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I concluded that the justice due
            both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his

            that <app id="var3557"><lem>thought</lem></app> only had to me the reality of life. Can you <app id="var3558"><lem>wonder,</lem></app> that sometimes a kind
            of insanity possessed <app id="var3559"><lem>me,</lem></app> or that I saw <app id="var3560"><lem>continually about</lem></app> me a multitude of filthy
            animals <app id="var3561"><lem>inflicting</lem></app> on me incessant <app id="var3562"><lem>torture,</lem></app> that often extorted <app id="var3563"><lem>screams and</lem></app> bitter

          <p><anchor id="struct328a"/><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_361" n="88"/>By degrees, however, these feelings became calmed. I
            entered again into the every-day scene of life, if not with interest, at least with some
            degree of tranquillity.</p>

          <p><app id="var3565"><lem>Day</lem></app> after day, week after <app id="var3566"><lem>week,</lem></app> passed away on my return to <app id="var3567"><lem>Geneva;</lem></app> and I <app id="var3568"><lem>could</lem></app> not
            <app id="var3569"><lem>collect the</lem></app> courage to <app id="var3570"><lem>recommence</lem></app> my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed
            <app id="var3571"><lem>fiend,</lem></app> yet I <app id="var3572"><lem>was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I
            found that I could</lem></app> not <app id="var3573"><lem>compose a female without again devoting several months to
            profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been
            made by <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_363" n="90"/>an English philosopher, the knowledge of which
            was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining</lem></app> my <app id="var3574"><lem>father’s consent</lem></app> to
            <app id="var3575"><lem>visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and could not
            resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity.</lem></app> My <app id="var3576"><lem>health,</lem></app> which had hitherto <app id="var3577"><lem>declined,</lem></app>
            was now much <app id="var3578"><lem>restored; and</lem></app> my <app id="var3579"><lem>spirits,</lem></app> when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy
            promise, rose <app id="var3580"><lem>proportionably.</lem></app> My father saw this <app id="var3581"><lem>change with pleasure,</lem></app> and he turned his
            thoughts towards the best <app id="var3582"><lem>method</lem></app> of eradicating the remains of my <app id="var3583"><lem>melancholy,</lem></app> which
            every now and then would return by <app id="var3584"><lem>fits, and</lem></app> with a devouring blackness <app id="var3585"><lem>overcast</lem></app> the
            approaching <app id="var3586"><lem>sunshine.</lem></app> At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect <app id="var3587"><lem>solitude.</lem></app> I
            passed whole days on the lake <app id="var3588"><lem>alone in a little boat, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_364" n="91"/>watching</lem></app> the <app id="var3589"><lem>clouds, and</lem></app> listening to the <app id="var3590"><lem>rippling</lem></app> of the waves, silent <app id="var3591"><lem>and</lem></app> listless.
            But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of
            <app id="var3592"><lem>composure; and,</lem></app> on my <app id="var3593"><lem>return,</lem></app> I met the <app id="var3594"><lem>salutations</lem></app> of my friends with a readier <app id="var3595"><lem>smile
            and</lem></app> a more cheerful <app id="var3596"><lem>heart.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct330a"/>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus
            addressed me:—</p>
          <p>“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and
            seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our
            society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday
            an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such
            a point would be not only use<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_365" n="92"/>less, but draw down
            treble misery on us all.”</p>
          <p>I trembled violently at this exordium, and my father continued—<anchor id="struct330b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3597"><lem>“I confess,</lem></app> my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with your cousin

            attached to <app id="var3600"><lem>each</lem></app> other from your earliest infancy; <app id="var3601"><lem>you</lem></app> studied <app id="var3602"><lem>together,</lem></app> and <app id="var3603"><lem>appeared,</lem></app>

            <app id="var3606"><lem>experience</lem></app> of <app id="var3607"><lem>man,</lem></app> that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
            entirely destroyed <app id="var3608"><lem>it. You, perhaps,</lem></app> regard her as your <app id="var3609"><lem>sister,</lem></app> without any wish that

          <p><anchor id="struct332a"/>“My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never
            saw any woman, who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My

          <p><anchor id="struct336a"/>I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering
            any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to
            arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my cousin was
            one of horror and dismay. I was bound <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_368" n="95"/>by a solemn
            promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold
            miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival
            with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must
            perform my engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself
            to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected peace.<anchor id="struct336b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3637"><lem>I</lem></app> remembered also the necessity <app id="var3638"><lem>imposed upon me</lem></app> of either <app id="var3639"><lem>journeying</lem></app> to <app id="var3640"><lem>England,</lem></app> or
            entering into a long correspondence with <app id="var3641"><lem>those</lem></app> philosophers of that <app id="var3642"><lem>country,</lem></app> whose
            knowledge and <app id="var3643"><lem>discoveries</lem></app> were of <app id="var3644"><lem>indispensable</lem></app> use <app id="var3645"><lem>to</lem></app> me <app id="var3646"><lem>in</lem></app> my present <app id="var3647"><lem>undertaking.</lem></app> The
            latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was <app id="var3648"><lem>dilatory</lem></app> and <app id="var3649"><lem>unsatisfactory:

            delighted with the idea of spending a year or two <app id="var3653"><lem>in change</lem></app> of scene <app id="var3654"><lem>and</lem></app> variety of
            <app id="var3655"><lem>occupation,</lem></app> in absence from my <app id="var3656"><lem>family;</lem></app> during which <app id="var3657"><lem>period</lem></app> some event might happen which
            would restore me to them in peace and <app id="var3658"><lem>happiness: my</lem></app> promise might be fulfilled, and the

            slavery for <app id="var3663"><lem>ever.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct338a"/>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England;
            but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under the guise
            of wishing to travel, and see the world before I sat down for life within the walls of
            my native town.</p>
          <p>I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced to comply; for a
            more indulgent and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_370" n="97"/>less dictatorial parent did not
            exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to Strasburgb, where
            Clerval would join me. Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland, and our
            principal stay would be in England. We should return by France; and it was agreed that
            the tour should occupy the space of two years.<anchor id="struct338b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3664"><lem>My</lem></app> father pleased himself with the <app id="var3665"><lem>reflection,</lem></app> that <app id="var3666"><lem>my union with</lem></app> Elizabeth <app id="var3667"><lem>should take
            place immediately</lem></app> on my return to Geneva. “These two years,” said he, “will pass
            <app id="var3668"><lem>swiftly,</lem></app> and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your <app id="var3669"><lem>happiness. And,
            indeed,</lem></app> I earnestly desire that period to <app id="var3670"><lem>arrive,</lem></app> when we shall all be <app id="var3671"><lem>united,</lem></app> and
            neither hopes or fears arise to disturb our <app id="var3672"><lem>domestic calm.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct340a"/>“I am content,” I replied, “ with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_371" n="98"/>your arrangement.
            By that time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we at present
            are.” I sighed ; but my father kindly forbore to question me further concerning the
            cause of my dejection. He hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of travelling, would
            restore my tranquillity.<anchor id="struct340b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3673"><lem>I</lem></app> now <app id="var3674"><lem>made</lem></app> arrangements for my <app id="var3675"><lem>journey;</lem></app> but one feeling haunted <app id="var3676"><lem>me,</lem></app> which filled <app id="var3677"><lem>me</lem></app>
            with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the
            existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, <app id="var3678"><lem>exasperated</lem></app> as he might be
            by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might <app id="var3679"><lem>go; an</lem></app> would he not
            <app id="var3680"><lem>accompany</lem></app> me to England? This <app id="var3681"><lem>imagination</lem></app> was dreadful in <app id="var3682"><lem>itself,</lem></app> but <app id="var3683"><lem>soothing, inasmuch</lem></app>
            as <app id="var3684"><lem>it</lem></app> supposed the safety of my <app id="var3685"><lem>friends.</lem></app> I was agonized <app id="var3686"><lem>with</lem></app> the idea of <app id="var3687"><lem>the</lem></app> pos<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_372" n="99"/>sibility that the reverse of this might happen. <app id="var3688"><lem>But</lem></app>
            through the whole period during which I was the slave of my <app id="var3689"><lem>creature,</lem></app> I allowed myself
            to be <app id="var3690"><lem>governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly
            intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family from the danger of his

          <p><anchor id="struct341a"/><app id="var3691"><lem>It</lem></app> was in the latter end of August that I <app id="var3692"><lem>departed,</lem></app> to pass two years of exile.
            <app id="var3693"><lem>Elizabeth</lem></app> approved of the reasons of my <app id="var3694"><lem>departure,</lem></app> and only regretted that she had not

            me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I
            remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that
            my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me: for I resolved to fulfil my
            promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free man. Filled with dreary
            imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes; but my eyes were
            fixed and unobserving. 1 could only think of the bourne of my travels, and the work

            course <app id="var3737"><lem>bf</lem></app> the Rhine below Mayence becomes much more picturesque. The river descends
            <app id="var3738"><lem>rapidly,</lem></app> and winds between <app id="var3739"><lem>hills,</lem></app> not <app id="var3740"><lem>high,</lem></app> but <app id="var3741"><lem>steep,</lem></app> and of beautiful forms. We saw
            many ruined <app id="var3742"><lem>castles</lem></app> standing on the edges of <app id="var3743"><lem>precipices,</lem></app> surrounded by black <app id="var3744"><lem>woods,</lem></app> high
            <app id="var3745"><lem>and</lem></app> inaccessible. This part of the <app id="var3746"><lem>Rhine, indeed,</lem></app> presents a <app id="var3747"><lem>singularly</lem></app> variegated
            <app id="var3748"><lem>landscape.</lem></app> In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined <app id="var3749"><lem>castles</lem></app> overlooking tremendous
            <app id="var3750"><lem>precipices,</lem></app> with the dark Rhine rushing <app id="var3751"><lem>beneath; and,</lem></app> on the sudden turn of a
            <app id="var3752"><lem>promontory, flourishing vineyards,</lem></app> with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_376" n="103"/>green sloping
            <app id="var3753"><lem>banks, and</lem></app> a meandering <app id="var3754"><lem>river, and populous towns, occupy the scene.</lem></app></p>

          <p><app id="var3755"><lem>We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of</lem></app> the <app id="var3756"><lem>labourers, as we
            glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated
            by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I
            gazed, on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had
            long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry ?
            He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom
            tasted by man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I
            have visited</lem></app> the lakes of Lucerne <app id="var3757"><lem>and Uri,</lem></app> where the snowy mountains descend <app id="var3758"><lem>almost</lem></app>

            the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay <app id="var3765"><lem>appearance;</lem></app> I have seen this
            lake agitated by a <app id="var3766"><lem>tempest,</lem></app> when the wind tore up whirlwinds of <app id="var3767"><lem>water,</lem></app> and gave you an
            idea of what the <app id="var3768"><lem>water-spout</lem></app> must be on the great <app id="var3769"><lem>ocean, and</lem></app> the waves dash with fury
            <app id="var3770"><lem>the</lem></app> base of the <app id="var3771"><lem>mountain,</lem></app> where the priest <app id="var3772"><lem>and</lem></app> his mistress were overwhelmed by an

            the <app id="var3774"><lem>nightly wind;</lem></app> I have seen the <app id="var3775"><lem>mountains</lem></app> of <app id="var3776"><lem>La Valais, and</lem></app> the <app id="var3777"><lem>Pays</lem></app> de <app id="var3778"><lem>Vaud: but</lem></app> this
            country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The <app id="var3779"><lem>mountains</lem></app> of Switzerland
            are more majestic <app id="var3780"><lem>and strange;</lem></app> but there is a charm in the banks of this divine <app id="var3781"><lem>river,</lem></app>
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_378" n="105"/>that I never before saw equalled. Look at that
            castle which overhangs <app id="var3782"><lem>yon precipice;</lem></app> and that also on the <app id="var3783"><lem>island,</lem></app> almost concealed
            <app id="var3784"><lem>amongst</lem></app> the foliage of those lovely <app id="var3785"><lem>trees; and now that group of labourers coming from
            among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely,
            the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than
            those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our
            own country.”</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct346a"/>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words, and to dwell on
            the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the
              <quote>“very poetry of nature.”</quote> His wild and enthusiastic imagination was
            chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul over<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_379" n="106"/>flowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and
            wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.
            But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of
            external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:

          <p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost or ever ? Has this
            mind so replete with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_380" n="107"/>ideas, imaginations fanciful and
            magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;
            has this mind perished ? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your

          <p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the

          <p>London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this
            wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and
            talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a secondary object; I was
            principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
            completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that
            I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.<anchor id="struct349b"/></p>

            come over my <app id="var3809"><lem>existence, and</lem></app> I only visited these people for the sake of the information
            they might <app id="var3810"><lem>give</lem></app> me on the subject in which <app id="var3811"><lem>my interest</lem></app> was so <app id="var3812"><lem>terribly profound.</lem></app> Company
            was <app id="var3813"><lem>irksome</lem></app> to me; when <app id="var3814"><lem>alone,</lem></app> I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven <app id="var3815"><lem>and</lem></app> earth;

            But <app id="var3819"><lem>busy uninteresting</lem></app> joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an
            insurmountable <app id="var3820"><lem>barrier</lem></app> placed between me <app id="var3821"><lem>and</lem></app> my fellow men; <app id="var3822"><lem>this</lem></app> barrier was sealed with

          <p><app id="var3827"><lem>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_384" n="111"/>anxious to</lem></app> gain experience <app id="var3828"><lem>and instruction.</lem></app> The
            difference of manners <app id="var3829"><lem>which</lem></app> he observed was to him <app id="var3830"><lem>an</lem></app> inexhaustible source of
            <app id="var3831"><lem>instruction and amusement.</lem></app> He was for ever <app id="var3832"><lem>busy; and</lem></app> the only check to his enjoyments
            was my <app id="var3833"><lem>sorrowful and</lem></app> dejected <app id="var3834"><lem>mind.</lem></app> I tried to conceal this as much as <app id="var3835"><lem>possible,</lem></app> that I
            might not debar him from the pleasures natural to <app id="var3836"><lem>one,</lem></app> who was entering on a new scene
            of life, undisturbed by any care or <app id="var3837"><lem>bitter</lem></app> recollection. I often refused to accompany
            <app id="var3838"><lem>him, alleging</lem></app> another <app id="var3839"><lem>engagement,</lem></app> that I might remain <app id="var3840"><lem>alone.</lem></app> I now also began to collect
            the materials necessary for my <app id="var3841"><lem>new creation, and</lem></app> this was <app id="var3842"><lem>to</lem></app> me like the torture of
            single drops of water continually falling on the <app id="var3843"><lem>head.</lem></app> Every thought that was devoted to
            it was <app id="var3844"><lem>an</lem></app> extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_385" n="112"/>caused my lips to <app id="var3845"><lem>quiver, and</lem></app> my heart to

          <p><anchor id="struct352a"/>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland,
            who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native
            country, and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong
            our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept
            this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and
            streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
            dwelling-places.<anchor id="struct352b"/></p>

          <p>We had arrived in <app id="var3847"><lem>England</lem></app> at the beginning of <app id="var3848"><lem>October,</lem></app> and it was now <app id="var3849"><lem>February. We
            accordingly</lem></app> determined to commence our journey towards the north <app id="var3850"><lem>at</lem></app> the expiration of
            another month. In this expedition we did not <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_386" n="113"/>intend
            to follow the great road to <app id="var3851"><lem>Edinburgh, but</lem></app> to visit Windsor, Oxford, <app id="var3852"><lem>Matlock, and</lem></app> the
            Cumberland <app id="var3853"><lem>lakes,</lem></app> resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of
            July. I packed <app id="var3854"><lem>up my</lem></app> chemical <app id="var3855"><lem>instruments, and</lem></app> the materials <app id="var3856"><lem>I</lem></app> had <app id="var3857"><lem>collected, resolving</lem></app>
            to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the <app id="var3858"><lem>northern highlands</lem></app> of <app id="var3859"><lem>Scotland.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct354a"/>We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in
            its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers ; the majestic oaks, the
            quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us.<anchor id="struct354b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct355a"/> <anchor id="struct355b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var3860"><lem>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our</lem></app> minds <app id="var3861"><lem>were</lem></app> filled with
            the remembrance of <app id="var3862"><lem>the</lem></app> events that had been transacted <app id="var3863"><lem>there more than</lem></app> a <app id="var3864"><lem>century and</lem></app> a
            half <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_3873" n="114"/>before. It was here that Charles <app id="var3865"><lem>I.</lem></app> had
            collected his <app id="var3866"><lem>forces. This city</lem></app> had <app id="var3867"><lem>remained</lem></app> faithful to <app id="var3868"><lem>him, after</lem></app> the whole nation had
            forsaken <app id="var3869"><lem>his cause</lem></app> to join the standard of parliament <app id="var3870"><lem>and</lem></app> liberty. <app id="var3871"><lem>The memory of that
            unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable Falkland,</lem></app> the <app id="var3872"><lem>insolent Goring, his
            queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be
            supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we
            delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary
            gratification, the appearance</lem></app> of the <app id="var3873"><lem>city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain
            our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
            magnificent;</lem></app> and the <app id="var3874"><lem>lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite
            verdure, is spread forth into a <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_388" n="115"/>placid expanse</lem></app> of
            <app id="var3875"><lem>waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage</lem></app> of <app id="var3876"><lem>towers, and spires, and domes,
            embosomed among aged trees.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct356a"/>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the
            past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my
            youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of
            what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart,
            and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered
            my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to
            be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and intolerable to
            myself.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_389" n="116"/>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling
            among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the
            most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often
            prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of
            the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul
            was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of
            liberty and self sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the
            remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a
            free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling
            and hopeless, into my miserable self.<anchor id="struct356b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3877"><lem>We left Oxford with regret, and pro<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_390" n="117"/>ceeded to
            Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in</lem></app> the <app id="var3878"><lem>neighbourhood</lem></app> of <app id="var3879"><lem>this
            village resembled,</lem></app> to <app id="var3880"><lem>a greater degree,</lem></app> the scenery of Switzerland; <app id="var3881"><lem>but</lem></app> every thing is
            on a lower <app id="var3882"><lem>scale, and</lem></app> the green <app id="var3883"><lem>hills</lem></app> want the <app id="var3884"><lem>crown</lem></app> of distant white <app id="var3885"><lem>Alps,</lem></app> which always

          <p><anchor id="struct358a"/>From Derby still journeying northward, we passed two months in Cumberland and
            Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_391" n="118"/>Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides
            of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams, were all familiar and
            dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat
            me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionally greater than mine; his mind
            expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater
            capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he
            associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life here, said he to me; “and among
            these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”<anchor id="struct358b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var3906"><lem>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland, and conceived
            an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our
            Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not
            sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the
            dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my
            relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every moment from which I might
            otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish im<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_393" n="120"/>patience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and</lem></app>
            overcome by a thousand fears; <app id="var3907"><lem>and</lem></app> when they <app id="var3908"><lem>arrived,</lem></app> and I saw the superscription of
            Elizabeth or my <app id="var3909"><lem>father,</lem></app> I hardly dared to read <app id="var3910"><lem>and ascertain</lem></app> my fate. Sometimes I

            followed him as his <app id="var3917"><lem>shadow,</lem></app> to protect him from <app id="var3918"><lem>the</lem></app> fancied rage of his destroyer. I
            felt as if I had <app id="var3919"><lem>committed</lem></app> some great <app id="var3920"><lem>crime,</lem></app> the <app id="var3921"><lem>consciousness</lem></app> of which haunted me. I

          <p><anchor id="struct362a"/>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested
            the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_394" n="121"/>as Oxford; for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But
            the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle, and its
            environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the
            Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and
            admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.<anchor id="struct362b"/></p>

            from a <app id="var3927"><lem>guest;</lem></app> and accordingly I told <app id="var3928"><lem>Clerval</lem></app> that I wished to make the tour of Scotland

          <p><anchor id="struct364a"/>Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.
            He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary
            rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know: hasten then, my dear friend,
            to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your

          <p><anchor id="struct366a"/>On the whole island there were but <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_397" n="124"/>three miserable
            huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained hut two
            rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch
            had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it
            to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession; an incident which would,
            doubtless, have occasioned some surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been
            benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested,
            hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering
            blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.<anchor id="struct366b"/></p>

            day and night in order to complete my work. It was indeed a filthy process in <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_399" n="126"/>which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind
            of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was
            intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of

          <p>I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from
            the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause
            of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night, or hasten its
            conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred
            to me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before
            I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity
            had desolated my <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_402" n="129"/>heart, and filled it for ever with
            the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I
            was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate,
            and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the
            neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in all
            probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a
            compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who
            already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
            for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust
            from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone,
            exasperated by the fresh <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_403" n="130"/>provocation of being
            deserted by one of his own species.<anchor id="struct370b"/></p>

            right,</lem></app> for my own <app id="var4002"><lem>benefit,</lem></app> to inflict this curse <app id="var4003"><lem>upon</lem></app> everlasting generations? I had

            promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their
            pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_404" n="131"/>the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human

          <p><anchor id="struct373a"/>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and
            treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like
            to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The
            wretch saW me destroy the creature on <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_405" n="132"/>whose future
            existence he depended for happiness, and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge,
            withdrew.</p>
          <p>I left, the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to
            resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was
            alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the sickening
            oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
          <p>Several hours past, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost
            motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet
            moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze
            wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,
            although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_406" n="133"/>until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore,
            and a person landed close to my house.<anchor id="struct373b"/></p>

            wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from <app id="var4027"><lem>mine; but</lem></app> I was

            contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an

            prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock,
            wearily it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it
            was to be sacrificed, or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon

            Clerval, entreating me to join him. He said that nearly a year had elapse since we had
            quitted Switzerland, and France was yet unvisited. He en<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_414" n="141"/>treated me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle, and meet him at Perth, in a
            week from that time, when we might arrange the plan of our future proceedings. This

            paused to collect <app id="var4134"><lem>myself, and</lem></app> then entered the chamber. With trembling <app id="var4135"><lem>hand</lem></app> I conveyed

            <app id="var4161"><lem>did not reflect</lem></app> that a voluntary act of mine <app id="var4162"><lem>could</lem></app> avert it. I had resolved in my own

            could lead to a different <app id="var4167"><lem>conclusion.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct386a"/>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket
            aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was
            perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from
            them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with
            shuddering <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_417" n="144"/>anxiety any encounter with my
            fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly
            overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my
            basket into the sea: I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away
            from the spot. The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the
            north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with such
            agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and, fixing the
            rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the
            moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut
            through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_418" n="145"/>I do not know how long I remained in this situation,
            but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was
            high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that
            the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had
            embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found that, if I again made the
            attempt, the boat would be instantly filled With water. Thus situated, my only resource
            was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no
            compass with me, and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
            world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide
            Atlantic, and feel all the tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the
            immeasurable <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_419" n="146"/>waters that roared and buffeted around
            me. I had already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a
            prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
            that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea, it was
            to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of
            Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; and sunk into a reverie, so despairing and
            frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever,
            I shudder to reflect on it.<anchor id="struct386b"/></p>

            where <app id="var4195"><lem>I could</lem></app> most easily <app id="var4196"><lem>procure nourishment.</lem></app> Fortunately I <app id="var4197"><lem>had</lem></app> money with me. As I
            turned the <app id="var4198"><lem>promontory,</lem></app> I <app id="var4199"><lem>perceived</lem></app> a small neat town <app id="var4200"><lem>and</lem></app> a good <app id="var4201"><lem>harbour,</lem></app> which I
            entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct390a"/>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded
            towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my appearance; but, instead of offering
            me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have
            produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke
            English; and I therefore addressed them in that language: My good friends,” said I,
            “will you be so <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_422" n="149"/>kind as to tell me the name of this
            town, and inform me where I am ?”</p>
          <p>“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.</p>
          <p>“May be you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste; but you will
            not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”</p>
          <p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger; and I was
            also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.
            “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I replied; “surely it is not the custom of Englishmen
            to receive strangers so inhospitably.”</p>
          <p>“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be; but it is the
            custom of the Irish to hate villains.”<anchor id="struct390b"/></p>

            <app id="var4211"><lem>replied.</lem></app> I then moved <app id="var4212"><lem>forward,</lem></app> and a <app id="var4213"><lem>murmuring sound arose</lem></app> from the <app id="var4214"><lem>crowd</lem></app> as they
            followed <app id="var4215"><lem>and</lem></app> surrounded <app id="var4216"><lem>me;</lem></app> when an <app id="var4217"><lem>ill-looking man approaching,</lem></app> tapped me on the

          <p><anchor id="struct392a"/>“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free

          <p>“Ay, Sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate; and you are to give
            an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.”<anchor id="struct392b"/></p>

            in <app id="var4227"><lem>silence, and</lem></app> was led to <app id="var4228"><lem>one of</lem></app> the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from

          <p>I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man, with
            calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity: and
            then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this
            occasion.<anchor id="struct394b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct395a"/> <anchor id="struct395b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4240"><lem>About</lem></app> half a dozen men came <app id="var4241"><lem>forward; and,</lem></app> one being selected by the <app id="var4242"><lem>magistrate,</lem></app> he
            <app id="var4243"><lem>deposed,</lem></app> that he had been out fishing the night before with his son <app id="var4244"><lem>and</lem></app> brother-in-law,
            Daniel Nugent, <app id="var4245"><lem>when,</lem></app> about <app id="var4246"><lem>ten o’clock,</lem></app> they ob<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_426" n="153"/>served
            a strong northerly blast <app id="var4247"><lem>rising, and</lem></app> they accordingly put in for port. It was a very
            dark <app id="var4248"><lem>night,</lem></app> as the moon had not yet risen; <app id="var4249"><lem>they</lem></app> did not <app id="var4250"><lem>land</lem></app> at the <app id="var4251"><lem>harbour,</lem></app> but, as
            they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He <app id="var4252"><lem>walked on first,</lem></app> carrying
            a part of the fishing <app id="var4253"><lem>tackle, and</lem></app> his companions followed him at some distance. As he
            was <app id="var4254"><lem>proceeding</lem></app> along the <app id="var4255"><lem>sands,</lem></app> he <app id="var4256"><lem>struck</lem></app> his foot against <app id="var4257"><lem>something, and</lem></app> fell <app id="var4258"><lem>at</lem></app> his
            length on the <app id="var4259"><lem>ground. His companions</lem></app> came up to assist <app id="var4260"><lem>him; and,</lem></app> by the light of their
            <app id="var4261"><lem>lantern,</lem></app> they <app id="var4262"><lem>found</lem></app> that he had fallen on the body of a <app id="var4263"><lem>man,</lem></app> who was to all appearance
            dead. Their first supposition <app id="var4264"><lem>was,</lem></app> that it was the corpse of <app id="var4265"><lem>some</lem></app> person who had been
            <app id="var4266"><lem>drowned, and was</lem></app> thrown on shore by the <app id="var4267"><lem>waves; but, on examination,</lem></app> they found that the
            clothes were not <app id="var4268"><lem>wet, and</lem></app> even that <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_427" n="154"/>the body was not
            <app id="var4269"><lem>then</lem></app> cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the <app id="var4270"><lem>spot, and
            endeavoured,</lem></app> but in <app id="var4271"><lem>vain,</lem></app> to restore it to <app id="var4272"><lem>life. It appeared to be a handsome young man,
            about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled; for there was no
            sign of any violence, except the black mark of fingers on his neck.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct396a"/>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but when the mark
            of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of my brother, and felt myself
            extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to
            lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and of course
            drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.</p>
          <p>The son confirmed his father’s ac<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_428" n="155"/>count: but when
            Daniel Nugent was called, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his
            companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
            and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which
            I had just landed.<anchor id="struct396b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct397a"/> <anchor id="struct397b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4273"><lem>A</lem></app> woman <app id="var4274"><lem>deposed,</lem></app> that she lived near the <app id="var4275"><lem>beach, and</lem></app> was standing at the door of her
            <app id="var4276"><lem>cottage,</lem></app> waiting for the return <app id="var4277"><lem>of the fishermen, about</lem></app> an hour before she heard of the
            <app id="var4278"><lem>discovery</lem></app> of the <app id="var4279"><lem>body, when</lem></app> she saw a <app id="var4280"><lem>boat,</lem></app> with only one <app id="var4281"><lem>man</lem></app> in <app id="var4282"><lem>it,</lem></app> push off from that
            part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards <app id="var4283"><lem>found.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct398a"/>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her
            house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed, and rubbed it; and Daniel went to the
              <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_429" n="156"/>town for an apothecary, but life was quite
            gone.</p>
          <p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed, that, with the
            strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had
            beaten about for many hours, and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from
            which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the
            body from another place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the shore,
            I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the
            place where I had deposited the corpse.<anchor id="struct398b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct399a"/> <anchor id="struct399b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4284"><lem>Mr. Kirwin,</lem></app> on hearing this <app id="var4285"><lem>evidence,</lem></app> desired that I should be taken into the room
            where the body lay for <app id="var4286"><lem>interment,</lem></app> that it might be observed <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_430" n="157"/>what effect the sight of it would <app id="var4287"><lem>produce</lem></app> upon me. This idea was probably
            suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited <app id="var4288"><lem>when</lem></app> the mode of the murder had been
            <app id="var4289"><lem>described.</lem></app> I was <app id="var4290"><lem>accordingly conducted,</lem></app> by the <app id="var4291"><lem>magistrate and</lem></app> several other <app id="var4292"><lem>persons,</lem></app> to
            the <app id="var4293"><lem>inn.</lem></app> I could not help being struck by the strange <app id="var4294"><lem>coincidences</lem></app> that had taken place
            during this eventful <app id="var4295"><lem>night; but,</lem></app> knowing that I had been <app id="var4296"><lem>conversing</lem></app> with several persons
            in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body <app id="var4297"><lem>had been found, I was
            perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct400a"/> <anchor id="struct400b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4298"><lem>I</lem></app> entered the room where the <app id="var4299"><lem>corpse lay, and</lem></app> was led up to the coffin. How can I
            <app id="var4300"><lem>describe</lem></app> my <app id="var4301"><lem>sensations on beholding it?</lem></app> I feel yet parched with <app id="var4302"><lem>horror,</lem></app> nor can I

            <app id="var4304"><lem>and agony.</lem></app> The <app id="var4305"><lem>examination,</lem></app> the presence of the magistrate <app id="var4306"><lem>and witnesses,</lem></app> passed like a
            dream from my <app id="var4307"><lem>memory,</lem></app> when I saw the lifeless form of Henry <app id="var4308"><lem>Clerval</lem></app> stretched before <app id="var4309"><lem>me.</lem></app>
            I gasped for <app id="var4310"><lem>breath; and,</lem></app> throwing myself on the <app id="var4311"><lem>body,</lem></app> I <app id="var4312"><lem>exclaimed, “Have</lem></app> my murderous

            <app id="var4322"><lem>benefactor”——</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct401a"/>The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried
            out of the room in strong convulsions.</p>
          <p>A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death: my ravings, as I
            afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_432" n="159"/>of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants
            to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom 1 was tormented; and at others, I
            felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony
            and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me;
            but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.</p>
          <p>Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into
            forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of
            their doating parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the
            bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of
            what materials was <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_433" n="160"/>I made, that I could thus resist
            so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the

          <p><anchor id="struct402a"/> <anchor id="struct402b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4323"><lem>But</lem></app> I was doomed to <app id="var4324"><lem>live; and,</lem></app> in two <app id="var4325"><lem>months,</lem></app> found myself <app id="var4326"><lem>as</lem></app> awaking from a dream, in
            a prison, stretched on a wretched <app id="var4327"><lem>bed,</lem></app> surrounded by <app id="var4328"><lem>gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and</lem></app> all
            the miserable apparatus of a <app id="var4329"><lem>dungeon.</lem></app> It was <app id="var4330"><lem>morning,</lem></app> I <app id="var4331"><lem>remember,</lem></app> when I thus awoke <app id="var4332"><lem>to

            some great <app id="var4335"><lem>misfortune</lem></app> had <app id="var4336"><lem>suddenly overwhelmed me; but</lem></app> when I looked <app id="var4337"><lem>around,</lem></app> and saw the
            barred windows, <app id="var4338"><lem>and</lem></app> the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my
            <app id="var4339"><lem>memory, and</lem></app> I groaned <app id="var4340"><lem>bitterly.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct403a"/>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_434" n="161"/>She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys,
            and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that
            class. The lines of her face were hard, and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see
            without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference;
            she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my
            sufferings:</p>
          <p>“Are you better now, Sir?” said she.</p>
          <p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am; but if it be all
            true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery
            and horror.”<anchor id="struct403b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct404a"/> <anchor id="struct404b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4341"><lem>“For</lem></app> that matter,” replied the old <app id="var4342"><lem>woman,</lem></app> “if you mean about the gentleman <app id="var4343"><lem>you
            murdered,</lem></app> I believe that <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_435" n="162"/>it were better for you if

          <p><anchor id="struct405a"/>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person
            just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid, and unable to reflect on all
            that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes
            doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the
            force of reality.</p>
          <p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness
            pressed around me: no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no

          <p><app id="var4370"><lem>One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open,

            addressed me in <app id="var4387"><lem>French—</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct408a"/>“I fear that this place is very shock<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_438" n="165"/>ing to you; can
            I do any thing to make you more comfortable?”</p>
          <p>“I thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole earth there is no
            comfort which I am capable of receiving.”</p>
          <p>“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down
            as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy
            abode; for, doubtless, evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal
            charge.”</p>
          <p>“That is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become the most
            miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any
            evil to me?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that
            have lately occurred. You <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_439" n="166"/>were thrown, by some
            surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality; seized immediately,
            and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of
            your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner, and placed, as it were, by some
            fiend across your path.”</p>
          <p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of
            my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess
            concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr.

            nearly a hundred miles to the county-town, where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged
            himself with every care of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence. I was spared
            the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the
            court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being
            proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found, and

            with a devouring <hi rend="italic">maladie du pays</hi>, to see once more the blue lake

            feeling was a torpor, in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene
            in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted, but by paroxysms of anguish and
            despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed;
            and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some

          <p><anchor id="struct423a"/>My father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having taken leave of Mr. Kirwin, we
            hastened to Dublin. I felt as if I was relieved from a heavy weight, when the packet
            sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and I had quitted for ever the country which had
            been to me the scene of so much misery.</p>
          <p>It was midnight. My father slept in <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_449" n="176"/>the cabin; and I
            lay on the deck, looking at the stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves. I
            hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish
            joy, when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the
            light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from
            the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
            that I was deceived by no vision, and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had
            fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole
            life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my
            mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered shuddering at the mad enthusiasm
            that hurried me on to the crea<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_450" n="177"/>tion of my hideous
            enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. I was unable to pursue

          <p><app id="var4529"><lem>We</lem></app> had resolved not to go to <app id="var4530"><lem>London,</lem></app> but to <app id="var4531"><lem>cross</lem></app> the country to <app id="var4532"><lem>Portsmouth,</lem></app> and <app id="var4533"><lem>thence</lem></app>
            to embark <app id="var4534"><lem>for</lem></app> Havre. I preferred this <app id="var4535"><lem>plan</lem></app> principally because I dreaded to see again
            those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments of <app id="var4536"><lem>tranquillity</lem></app> with my beloved
            <app id="var4537"><lem>Clerval.</lem></app> <app id="var4538"><lem>I</lem></app> thought with horror of seeing <app id="var4539"><lem>again those persons</lem></app> whom we had been accustomed

            inquiries</lem></app> concerning an <app id="var4542"><lem>event,</lem></app> the very remembrance of which <app id="var4543"><lem>made</lem></app> me again feel <app id="var4544"><lem>the pang</lem></app>
            I endured <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_453" n="180"/>when I gazed on his lifeless <app id="var4545"><lem>form in</lem></app> the
            <app id="var4546"><lem>inn at ——.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct427a"/>As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again seeing me
            restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness and attentions were unremitting; my
            grief and gloom was obstinate, but he would not despair. Sometimes he thought that I
            felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he
            endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.</p>
          <p>“Alas! my father,” said I, “how little, do you know me. Human beings, their feelings
            and passions, would indeed be degraded, if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor
            unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for
            it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_453" n="180"/>and Henry—they all died by my hands.”<anchor id="struct427b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4547"><lem>My</lem></app> father had <app id="var4548"><lem>often,</lem></app> during my <app id="var4549"><lem>imprisonment,</lem></app> heard me make the same <app id="var4550"><lem>assertion; when</lem></app> I
            <app id="var4551"><lem>thus accused</lem></app> myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an <app id="var4552"><lem>explanation, and</lem></app> at others he
            appeared to consider it as <app id="var4553"><lem>the offspring of delirium, and that,</lem></app> during my <app id="var4554"><lem>illness,</lem></app> some
            idea of this kind had presented itself to my <app id="var4555"><lem>imagination,</lem></app> the <app id="var4556"><lem>remembrance</lem></app> of which I
            preserved in my <app id="var4557"><lem>convalescence.</lem></app> I avoided <app id="var4558"><lem>explanation, and maintained a,</lem></app> continual
            silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a feeling that I should be supposed
            <app id="var4559"><lem>mad,</lem></app> and this for ever chained my <app id="var4560"><lem>tongue,</lem></app> when I would have given the whole world to
            have confided the fatal <app id="var4561"><lem>secret.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct429a"/>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “What do you
            mean, Victor? <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_455" n="182"/>are you mad? My dear son, I entreat you
            never to make such an assertion again.”</p>
          <p>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
            operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent
            victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood,
            drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
            sacrifice the whole human race.”</p>
          <p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he
            instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and endeavored to alter the course of
            my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of scenes that had
            taken place in Ireland, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_456" n="183"/>and never alluded to them, or
            suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.<anchor id="struct429b"/></p>

            consciousness of them. By the utmost <app id="var4567"><lem>self-violence,</lem></app> I curbed the imperious voice of
            <app id="var4568"><lem>wretchedness,</lem></app> which <app id="var4569"><lem>sometimes desired</lem></app> to declare itself to the whole <app id="var4570"><lem>world; and</lem></app> my

          <p><app id="var4659"><lem>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and re-read her letter, and some softened feelings
            stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical dreams of love and joy; but the

            hour.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct439a"/>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. “I
            fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that
            I may one day enjoy is centred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I
            consecrate my life, and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
            dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far
            from being <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_465" n="192"/>surprised at my misery, you will only
            wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror
            to you the day after our marriage shall take place; for, my sweet cousin, there must be
            perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude
            to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”</p>
          <p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter, we returned to Geneva. My
            cousin welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her eyes, as she beheld my
            emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner, and

          <p><anchor id="struct441a"/>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe
            me when transported by passion, and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
            She wept with me, and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour
            to inspire me with resignation. Ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but
            for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_467" n="194"/>otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of

          <p><anchor id="struct444a"/>Great God! if for one instant I <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_469" n="196"/>had thought what

            myself for ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over the
            earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic
            powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I
            prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.</p>
          <p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic
            feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of
            hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly
            deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union
            with placid contentment, not <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_470" n="197"/>unmingled with a little
            fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible

          <p><anchor id="struct446a"/><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_471" n="198"/>In the mean time I took every precaution to defend
            my person, in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
            constantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and by these means
            gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat
            appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the
            happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day
            fixed for its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of as an
            occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But
            on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_472" n="199"/>a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also
            she thought of the dreadful secret, which I had promised to reveal to her the following
            day. My father was in the mean time overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only
            recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.</p>
          <p>After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my father’s; but it was
            agreed that Elizabeth and I should pass the afternoon and night at Evian, and return to
            Cologny the next morning. As the day was fair, and the wind favourable, we resolved to
            go by water.<anchor id="struct446b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct448a"/>I took the hand of Elizabeth: “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! if you knew what I have

          <p><anchor id="struct450a"/>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon

            and reverie.</p>
          <p>The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and observed its path
            through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come
            closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its
            eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the

          <p><anchor id="struct454a"/>I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a
            thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped
            a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I
            would sell my life dearly, and not shrink from the conflict until my own life, or that
            of my adversary, was extinguished.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence; at length
            she said, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear ?”</p>
          <p>“Oh! peace, peace, my love, re<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_479" n="206"/>plied I; "this night,

            She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld <app id="var4851"><lem>her; and now,</lem></app> as she
            <app id="var4852"><lem>lay,</lem></app> her head upon her <app id="var4853"><lem>arm,</lem></app> and <app id="var4854"><lem>a handkerchief</lem></app> thrown across her face <app id="var4855"><lem>and neck,</lem></app> I might
            have <app id="var4856"><lem>supposed</lem></app> her <app id="var4857"><lem>asleep.</lem></app> I rushed towards <app id="var4858"><lem>her, and</lem></app> embraced her with <app id="var4859"><lem>ardour;</lem></app> but the
            <app id="var4860"><lem>deadly languor and</lem></app> coldness of the <app id="var4861"><lem>limbs</lem></app> told <app id="var4862"><lem>me,</lem></app> that what I now held in <app id="var4863"><lem>iny</lem></app> arms had
            ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved <app id="var4864"><lem>and cherished. The</lem></app> <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_482" n="208"/>murderous <app id="var4865"><lem>mark</lem></app> of the <app id="var4866"><lem>fiend's grasp</lem></app> was on her <app id="var4867"><lem>neck, and</lem></app> the breath had

          <p><anchor id="struct458a"/>While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows
            of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale
            yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and,
            with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the
            most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as
            with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the
            window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, shot; but he eluded me, leaped from his
            station, and, running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.<anchor id="struct458b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct460a"/>I did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a film covered my eyes,: and my skin was
            parched with the heat of fever. In this state I lay on a bed, hardly conscious of what
            had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something thiat I had
            lost.</p>
          <p>At length I remembered that my fa* ther would anxiously expect the return <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_484" n="211"/>of Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return alone.
            This reflection brought tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my thoughts
            rambled to various subjects, reflecting on my misfortunes, and their cause. I was
            bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of
            Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not
            that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even
            now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea
            made me shudder, and recalled me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to
            Geneva with all possible speed.<anchor id="struct460b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var4888"><lem>There</lem></app> were no horses to be <app id="var4889"><lem>procured,</lem></app> and I must return by the <app id="var4890"><lem>lake;</lem></app> but the wind was
            <app id="var4891"><lem>unfavourable,</lem></app> and <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_485" n="212"/>the rain fell in torrents. <app id="var4892"><lem>However,

            <app id="var4898"><lem>row,</lem></app> and took an oar <app id="var4899"><lem>myself,</lem></app> for I had always <app id="var4900"><lem>experienced</lem></app> relief <app id="var4901"><lem>from</lem></app> mental <app id="var4902"><lem>torment</lem></app> in

            head upon my <app id="var4907"><lem>hands,</lem></app> gave way to every gloomy idea that <app id="var4908"><lem>arose. If</lem></app> I looked <app id="var4909"><lem>up,</lem></app> I saw the

            an event is single in the history of man.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct462a"/>But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event.

            only</lem></app> objects that pressed upon <app id="var4958"><lem>me. Sometimes, indeed,</lem></app> I <app id="var4959"><lem>dreamt</lem></app> that I wandered in
            flowery <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_488" n="215"/>meadows <app id="var4960"><lem>and</lem></app> pleasant vales with the friends

            degrees I <app id="var4965"><lem>gained</lem></app> a clear conception of my miseries <app id="var4966"><lem>and situation, and</lem></app> was then released
            from my prison. For they had called me <app id="var4967"><lem>mad; and during</lem></app> many <app id="var4968"><lem>months,</lem></app> as I <app id="var4969"><lem>understood,</lem></app> a
            solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct465a"/>Liberty, however, had been an useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason,
            at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me,
            I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon
            whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening
            rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_489" n="216"/>within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on
            his cursed head.</p>
          <p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best
            means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired
            to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I
            knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority
            for the apprehension of the murderer.</p>
          <p>The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: “Be assured, sir,” said he,
            “ no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.”<anchor id="struct465b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct466a"/> <anchor id="struct466b"/></p>
          <p><app id="var4970"><lem>“I</lem></app> thank you,” <app id="var4971"><lem>replied I;</lem></app> “ <app id="var4972"><lem>listen, therefore,</lem></app> to <app id="var4973"><lem>the</lem></app> deposition <app id="var4974"><lem>that I</lem></app> have to <app id="var4975"><lem>make.</lem></app>
            It is <app id="var4976"><lem>indeed</lem></app> a tale so <app id="var4977"><lem>strange,</lem></app> that I <app id="var4978"><lem>should fear</lem></app> you would not credit <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_490" n="217"/><app id="var4979"><lem>it,</lem></app> were there not <app id="var4980"><lem>something</lem></app> in truth <app id="var4981"><lem>which,</lem></app> however

            I have no motive for falsehood.” My <app id="var4985"><lem>manner,</lem></app> as I <app id="var4986"><lem>thus addressed him,</lem></app> was <app id="var4987"><lem>impressive,</lem></app> but
            calm; I had formed in my own heart <app id="var4988"><lem>a</lem></app> resolution to pursue my destroyer to <app id="var4989"><lem>death; and</lem></app>
            this purpose quieted my <app id="var4990"><lem>agony, and for an interval</lem></app> reconciled me to life. I now related
            my history <app id="var4991"><lem>briefly,</lem></app> but with firmness <app id="var4992"><lem>and precision,</lem></app> marking <app id="var4993"><lem>the dates</lem></app> with <app id="var4994"><lem>accuracy,</lem></app>
            and never deviating into invective or <app id="var4995"><lem>exclamation.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct467a"/>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became
            more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a
            lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_491" n="218"/>When I had concluded my narration,</p>
          <p>I said, “This is the being whom I accuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call
            upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and
            hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions
            on this occasion.”<anchor id="struct467b"/></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct468a"/> <anchor id="struct468b"/></p>
          <p>This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my auditor. He had
            heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and
            supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the
            whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly
            afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have
            powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_492" n="219"/>Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and
            dens, where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the
            commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or
            what region he may now inhabit.”</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct469a"/>“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed
            taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of
            prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to
            pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.”</p>
          <p>As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated: “You are
            mistaken,” said he, “ I will <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_493" n="220"/>exert myself; and if it
            is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment
            proportionate to his crimes; But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his
            properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is
            pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.”<anchor id="struct469b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct471a"/><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_494" n="221"/>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this;
            there was a phrenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty
            fierceness, which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
            magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and
            heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to
            soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale as the effects of
            delirium.</p>
          <p>“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom ! Cease; you know not
            what it is you say.,</p>
          <p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on some other mode

          <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
          <p>My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.
            I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it
            moulded my feelings, and allowed me to be calculating and calm, at periods when
            otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.</p>
          <p>My first resol utibn was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy
            and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself
            with <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_496" n="223"/>a sum of money, together with a few jewels which
            had belonged to my mother, and departed.</p>
          <p>And, now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast
            portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which travellers, in deserts
            and barbarous countries, are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times
            have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death. But
            revenge kept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.<anchor id="struct471b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct474a"/>I had begun my adjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_499" n="226"/>assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard
            and approved my devotion; but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choaked
            my utterance.</p>
          <p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rung on
            my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell
            surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been
            possessed by phrenzy, and have destroyed my miserable existence, but that my vow was
            heard, and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away; when a well-known
            and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper—“I am
            satisfied: miserable wretch! you have determined to live, and I am satisfied.”</p>
          <p><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_500" n="227"/>I darted towards the spot from which the sound
            proceeded; but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and
            shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than mortal
            speed.<anchor id="struct474b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var5086"><lem>I pursued</lem></app> <app id="var5087"><lem>him; and</lem></app> for many months this has been my task. <app id="var5088"><lem>Guided</lem></app> by a slight <app id="var5089"><lem>clue,</lem></app> I
            <app id="var5090"><lem>followed</lem></app> the windings of the <app id="var5091"><lem>Rhone,</lem></app> but <app id="var5092"><lem>vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared; and,</lem></app> by
            a strange <app id="var5093"><lem>chance,</lem></app> I saw the fiend enter by <app id="var5094"><lem>night, and</lem></app> hide himself in a vessel bound for
            the <app id="var5095"><lem>Black Sea. I took my passage in</lem></app> the <app id="var5096"><lem>same ship; but he escaped, I know not</lem></app> <app id="var5097"><lem>how.</lem></app></p>
          <p><anchor id="struct476a"/>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever
            followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition,
            informed me of his <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_501" n="228"/>path; sometimes he himself, who
            feared that if I lost all trace of him, I should despair and die, left some mark to
            guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the
            white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how
            can you understand what I have felt, and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue, were the
            least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and carried
            about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my
            steps, and, when I most murmured, would suddenly extricate me from seemingly
            insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the
            exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited me.
            The fare was indeed <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_502" n="229"/>coarse, such as the peasants of
            the country ate; but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had
            invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by
            thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and
            vanjsh.<anchor id="struct476b"/></p>

            me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! often, when
            most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits
            that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness, that I might
            retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite,</lem></app> I should have sunk
            under my <app id="var5119"><lem>hardships. During</lem></app> the day I was <app id="var5120"><lem>sustained and inspirited</lem></app> by the hope of <app id="var5121"><lem>night:</lem></app>
            <app id="var5122"><lem>for</lem></app> in sleep I saw my <app id="var5123"><lem>friends,</lem></app> my <app id="var5124"><lem>wife, and</lem></app> my beloved <app id="var5125"><lem>country;</lem></app> again I saw the

            agonizing fondness did I feel for <app id="var5139"><lem>them! how</lem></app> did I cling to their dear <app id="var5140"><lem>forms,</lem></app> as
            sometimes they <app id="var5141"><lem>haunted</lem></app> even my <app id="var5142"><lem>waking hours, and persuade</lem></app> myself that they still <app id="var5143"><lem>lived!</lem></app>

          <p><anchor id="struct479a"/>What his feelings were whom I pursued, I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks
            in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone, that guided me, and instigated my
            fury. “My reign is not yet over,” (these words were legible in one of these
            inscriptions); “you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the ever<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_505" n="232"/>lasting ices of the north, where you will feel the
            misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you
            follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat, and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have
            yet to wrestle for our lives; but many hard and miserable hours must you endure, until

          <p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to
            torture and death. Never will I give up my search, until he or I perish; and then with

            most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced <app id="var5161"><lem>from their
            hiding-places</lem></app> to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with <app id="var5162"><lem>ice,</lem></app> and no fish could be

          <p><anchor id="struct481a"/>The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription
            that he left was in these words: “Prepare! your toils only begin: wrap yourself in furs,
            and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will
            satisfy my everlasting hatred.”</p>
          <p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to
            fail in my purpose; and, calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated
            fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean ap<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_507" n="234"/>peared at a distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! how unlike it
            was to the blue seas of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished
            from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they
            beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of
            their toils. I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a full heart, thanked my
            guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding
            my adversary’s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.<anchor id="struct481b"/></p>

          <p><anchor id="struct484a"/><pb xml:id="F1823_v2_510" n="237"/>I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned for the
            inequalities of the frozen ocean; and, purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
            departed from land.</p>
          <p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have endured misery, which
            nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could
            have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my
            passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my
            destruction. But again the frost came, and made the paths of the sea secure.<anchor id="struct484b"/></p>

          <p><app id="var5231"><lem>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed
            three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon
            the heart, often <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_511" n="238"/>wrung bitter drops of despondency
            and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon
            have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after</lem></app> the poor animals that <app id="var5232"><lem>conveyed</lem></app> me <app id="var5233"><lem>had</lem></app> with

            a dark speck <app id="var5240"><lem>upon</lem></app> the dusky <app id="var5241"><lem>plain,</lem></app> I strained my sight to <app id="var5242"><lem>discover</lem></app> what <app id="var5243"><lem>it</lem></app> could <app id="var5244"><lem>be, and</lem></app>
            uttered a wild cry of <app id="var5245"><lem>ecstacy When</lem></app> I distinguished a <app id="var5246"><lem>sledge, and</lem></app> the distorted
            proportions of a <app id="var5247"><lem>wellknown</lem></app> form <app id="var5248"><lem>within. Oh!</lem></app> with what a burning gush did hope revisit my
            <app id="var5249"><lem>heart!</lem></app> warm tears filled my <app id="var5250"><lem>eyes,</lem></app> which I hastily wiped <app id="var5251"><lem>away,</lem></app> that they might not
            <app id="var5252"><lem>intercept</lem></app> the view I had of the <app id="var5253"><lem>dæmon;</lem></app> but still <app id="var5254"><lem>my sight was dimmed by the <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_512" n="239"/>burning drops, until,</lem></app> giving way to the emotions that
            oppressed <app id="var5255"><lem>me,</lem></app> I wept aloud.</p>
          <p><anchor id="struct486a"/>But this was not the time for delay: I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion,
            gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an hour’s rest, which was absolutely
            necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge
            was still visible; nor did I again lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a
            short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly
            gained on it; and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I beheld my enemy at no more
            than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.</p>
          <p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my enemy, my hopes were suddenly
            extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_513" n="240"/>ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder
            of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more
            ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as
            with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split, and cracked with a tremendous and
            overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled
            between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that was
            continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.<anchor id="struct486b"/></p>

          you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the

          really existence! I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I
          endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation; but on

        <p>“Are you mad, my friend?“ said he; “or whither does your senseless curio<pb xml:id="F1823_v2_518" n="245"/>sity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the

          your own.”</p>
        <p>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them,
          and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but principally in giving
          the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved
          my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to

        <p>MY BELOVED SISTER,</p>
        <p>I write to you, encompassed by peril, and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again
          dear England, and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_525" n="252"/>am surrounded by mountains of ice, which admit of no escape, and threaten every moment
          to crush my vessel. The brave fellows, whom I have persuaded to be my companions, look
          towards me for aid; but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in
          our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. We my survive; and if we do not,
          I will repeat the lessons of my Seneca, and die with a good heart.</p>
        <p>Yet what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction,
          and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of
          despair, and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! my beloved sister, the sickening failing of your
          heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more, terrible to me than my own death. But you
          have a <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_526" n="253"/>husband, and lovely children; you may be happy:

        <p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest, that although it is highly probable
          that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.</p>
        <p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in
          their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already
          found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health:
          a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes; but he is exhausted, and, when suddenly roused
          to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.<anchor id="struct501b"/></p>

        <p><app id="var5501"><lem>I</lem></app> mentioned <app id="var5502"><lem>in my</lem></app> last letter the fears I <app id="var5503"><lem>entertained</lem></app> of <app id="var5504"><lem>a mutiny.</lem></app> This <app id="var5505"><lem>morning,</lem></app> as I sat
          watching the wan countenance of my <app id="var5506"><lem>friend—his</lem></app> eyes <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_528" n="255"/>half
          <app id="var5507"><lem>closed,</lem></app> and his limbs hanging <app id="var5508"><lem>listlessly,—I</lem></app> was <app id="var5509"><lem>roused</lem></app> by half a dozen of the <app id="var5510"><lem>sailors,</lem></app> who
          <app id="var5511"><lem>demanded</lem></app> admission into the <app id="var5512"><lem>cabin. They entered, and</lem></app> their leader <app id="var5513"><lem>addressed</lem></app> me. He told me
          that he <app id="var5514"><lem>and</lem></app> his <app id="var5515"><lem>companions</lem></app> had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to
          <app id="var5516"><lem>me,</lem></app> to make <app id="var5517"><lem>me a requisition, which,</lem></app> in <app id="var5518"><lem>justice,</lem></app> I could not refuse. We were immured <app id="var5519"><lem>in
          ice, and should</lem></app> probably never <app id="var5520"><lem>escape;</lem></app> but they feared that if, as was <app id="var5521"><lem>possible,</lem></app> the ice
          should <app id="var5522"><lem>dissipate,</lem></app> and a free passage <app id="var5523"><lem>be opened,</lem></app> I should be rash enough to <app id="var5524"><lem>continue</lem></app> my
          <app id="var5525"><lem>voyage, and</lem></app> lead them <app id="var5526"><lem>into</lem></app> fresh <app id="var5527"><lem>dangers,</lem></app> after they <app id="var5528"><lem>might happily</lem></app> have <app id="var5529"><lem>surmounted</lem></app> this.
          They <app id="var5530"><lem>insisted, therefore,</lem></app> that I should <app id="var5531"><lem>engage with</lem></app> a solemn <app id="var5532"><lem>promise,</lem></app> that <app id="var5533"><lem>if</lem></app> the vessel
          should be <app id="var5534"><lem>freed I would instantly direct my course southward.</lem></app></p>
        <p><anchor id="struct503a"/>This speech troubled me. I had <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_529" n="256"/>not despaired; nor had
          I yet conceited the idea of returning, if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in
          possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered; when Frankenstein, who had
          at first been silent, and, indeed, appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now
          roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning
          towards the men, he said—<anchor id="struct503b"/></p>

        <p><app id="var5535"><lem>“What</lem></app> do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you then so easily turned from

          Not because the way was smooth <app id="var5539"><lem>and</lem></app> placid as a <app id="var5540"><lem>southern sea,</lem></app> but because it was full of

          are content to be <app id="var5567"><lem>handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril;
          and so, poor souls, they were chilly, and returned to their warm fire-sides. Why, that
          requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far, and dragged your captain to
          the shame of a defeat, merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! be men, or <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_531" n="258"/>be more than men. Be steady to your purposes, and firm as
          a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable, cannot
          withstand you, if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the
          stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return, as heroes who have fought and conquered,
          and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”</lem></app></p>

        <p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?
          What can I say, that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow ? All that I
          should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a
          cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find
          consolation.</p>
        <p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly,
          and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again; there is a sound as of a human voice, but <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_540" n="267"/>hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of
          Frankenstein still lie. I must arise, and examine. Good night, my sister.</p>
        <p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it.
          I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have

        <p>“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed: “in his murder my crimes are consummated; the

          strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death his throat who never injured me
          or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is
          worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that
          irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me; but your
          abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which
          executed the deed; I think on the heart <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_550" n="277"/>in which the
          imagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when these hands will meet my
