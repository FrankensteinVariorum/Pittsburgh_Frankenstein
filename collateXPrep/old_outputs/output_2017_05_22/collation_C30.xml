The moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly, and not <app><rdg wit="#f1818">relax the impending </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">shrink from the </rdg></app>conflict until my own life, or that of my adversary, <app><rdg wit="#f1818">were </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">was </rdg></app>extinguished. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">at length she said, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling she asked, </rdg></app>“What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">fear?” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">fear ?” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Oh! peace, peace, my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">love,” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">love, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">re&lt;pb n="v3_118" xml:id="F1818_v3_122"/&gt;plied I, “this </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">re&lt;pb n="206" xml:id="F1823_v2_479"/&gt;plied I; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">replied I; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1823">"this </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">“this </rdg></app>night, and all will be safe: but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">dreadful </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">fearful </rdg></app>the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house, and inspecting every corner &lt;pb n="175" xml:id="F1831_v_191"/&gt;that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins, and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Great God! why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope, and the purest creature of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">earth. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">earth? </rdg></app>She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down, and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Every where I turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this, and live? Alas! life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">fainted. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">fell senseless on the ground. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her, and embraced her with ardour; but the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">deathly </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">deadly </rdg></app>languor and coldness of the limbs told me, that what I now held in <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">my </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">iny </rdg></app>arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">fiend’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">fiend's </rdg></app>grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows of the room had before &lt;pb n="176" xml:id="F1831_v_192"/&gt;been <app><rdg wit="#f1818">darkened; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">darkened, </rdg></app>and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">shot; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">fired; </rdg></app>but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">up </rdg></app>by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">did not </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">attempted to </rdg></app>accompany <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">them; I was exhausted: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">them, and proceeded a short distance from the house; but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; </rdg></app>a film covered my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">eyes, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">eyes,: </rdg></app>and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">lay </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">was carried back, and placed </rdg></app>on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room, as if to seek something <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">that </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">thiat </rdg></app>I had lost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">At length I remembered that my </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">After an interval, I arose, and, as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around—I hung over it, and joined my sad </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">father </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">fa* ther </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">would anxiously expect the return &lt;pb n="v3_123" xml:id="F1818_v3_127"/&gt;of Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return alone. This reflection brought </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">would anxiously expect the return &lt;pb n="211" xml:id="F1823_v2_484"/&gt;of Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return alone. This reflection brought </rdg></app>tears <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">to theirs—all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind; </rdg></app>but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting <app><rdg wit="#f1831">confusedly </rdg></app>on my misfortunes, and their cause. I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder, and re&lt;pb n="177" xml:id="F1831_v_193"/&gt;called me to action. I started up, and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row, and took an oar <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">myself, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">myself; </rdg></app>for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">and </rdg></app>leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine, or the clouds might <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">lour; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">lower: </rdg></app>but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">event. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">event? </rdg></app>Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their &lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;acme&lt;/hi&gt;, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">lived; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">lived ; </rdg></app>but the former sunk under the tidings that I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">bore. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">bore, </rdg></app>I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight—his <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">niece, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Elizabeth, </rdg></app>his more than daughter, whom he doated on with all that affection which a man feels, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">who, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">who </rdg></app>in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend &lt;pb n="178" xml:id="F1831_v_194"/&gt;that brought misery on his grey hairs, and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">an apoplectic fit was brought on, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">the springs of existence suddenly gave way: he was unable to rise from his bed, </rdg></app>and in a few days he died in my arms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth; but <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">I </rdg></app>awoke, and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation, and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">But liberty had been a </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Liberty, however, had been an </rdg></app>useless gift to <app><rdg wit="#f1818">me </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">me, </rdg></app>had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable <app><rdg wit="#f1818">daemon </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">dæmon </rdg></app>whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and told him that I had an accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of my family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The magistrate listened to me with attention and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">kindness: “Be </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">kindness:—“Be </rdg></app>assured, sir,” said he, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">“no </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">“ no </rdg></app>pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I thank you,” replied I; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">“listen, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">“ listen, </rdg></app>therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange, that I should fear you would not credit it, were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mis&lt;pb n="179" xml:id="F1831_v_195"/&gt;taken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My manner, as I thus addressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my agony, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">provisionally </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">for an interval </rdg></app>reconciled me to life. I now related my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">history </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">history, </rdg></app>briefly, but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy, and never deviating into invective or exclamation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When I had concluded my narration, <app><rdg wit="#f1823">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; </rdg></app>I said, “This is the being whom I accuse, and for whose <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">detection </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">seizure </rdg></app>and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my <app><rdg wit="#f1831">own </rdg></app>auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice, and inhabit caves and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">dens, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">dens </rdg></app>where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region he may now inhabit.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois, and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts: you do not credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;pb n="180" xml:id="F1831_v_196"/&gt;As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was <app><rdg wit="#f1818">intimidated; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">intimidated: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">intimidated:—“You </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">“You </rdg></app>are mistaken,” said he, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">“I </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">“ I </rdg></app>will exert myself; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and </rdg></app>if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">crimes. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">crimes; </rdg></app>But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">impracticable, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">impracticable; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">and that, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and thus, </rdg></app>while every proper measure is pursued, you should <app><rdg wit="#f1818">endeavour to </rdg></app>make up your mind to disappointment.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand: I have but one resource; and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">phrenzy </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">frenzy </rdg></app>in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">fierceness, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">fierceness </rdg></app>which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">wisdom! </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">wisdom ! </rdg></app>Cease; you know not what it is you <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">say.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">say., </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on some other mode of action. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="22" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;comment&gt; ebb: centered underscore a few lines below &lt;/comment&gt;&lt;milestone n="23" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
