          advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its
          homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land,
          perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold, and apparently
          firm of purpose; nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indi<pb xml:id="F1818_v1_031" n="019"/>cating the dangers of the region towards which we are
          advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is
          the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which
          blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a
          degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.<p loc="novel1_letter3_p30__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter3_p31__Start"/>No incidents have hitherto befallen us, that would make a figure in a letter. One or two
          stiff gales, and the breaking of a mast, are accidents which experienced navigators
          scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content, if nothing worse happen to us
          during our voyage.<p loc="novel1_letter3_p31__End"/>
