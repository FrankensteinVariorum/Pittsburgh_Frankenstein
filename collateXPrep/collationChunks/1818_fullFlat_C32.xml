        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p711__Start"/>August 26th, 17—.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p711__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p712__Start"/>Y<hi rend="smallcaps">OU</hi> have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do
          you not feel your blood congealed with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?
          Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice
          broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with agony. His fine
          and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and
          quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones, and
          related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of
          agitation; then, like a volcano bursting <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_160" n="156"/>forth, his
          face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out
          imprecations on his persecutor.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p712__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p713__Start"/>His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the simplest truth; yet I own to
          you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he shewed me, and the apparition of the
          monster, seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his
          narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has then
          really existence; I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I
          endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s formation; but on
          this point he was impenetrable.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p713__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p714__Start"/>“Are you mad, my friend?” said he, “or whither does your senseless curio<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_161" n="157"/>sity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and
          the world a demoniacal enemy? Or to what do your questions tend? Peace, peace! learn my
          miseries, and do not seek to increase your own.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p714__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p715__Start"/>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them,
          and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places; but principally in giving
          the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. “Since you have preserved
          my narration,” said he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
          posterity.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p715__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p716__Start"/>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever
          imagination formed. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up by the
          interest for my guest, which this tale, and his own <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_162" n="158"/>elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him; yet can I counsel one so
          infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only
          joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered feelings to peace and
          death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium: he believes,
          that, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that communion
          consolation for his miseries, or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the
          creations of his fancy, but the real beings who visit him from the regions of a remote
          world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as
          imposing and interesting as truth.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p716__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p717__Start"/>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and mis<pb xml:id="F1818_v3_163" n="159"/>fortunes. On every point of general literature he
          displays unbounded knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is
          forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or
          endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature
          must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in
          ruin. He seems to feel his own worth, and the greatness of his fall.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p717__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p718__Start"/>“When younger,” said he, “I felt as if I were destined for some great enterprise. My
          feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for
          illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me, when
          others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_164" n="160"/>grief those talents that might be useful to my
          fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the
          creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of
          common projectors. But this feeling, which supported me in the commencement of my career,
          now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as
          nothing; and, like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal
          hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by
          the union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a man.
          Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. I
          trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_165" n="161"/>their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high
          hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I
          once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely
          visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to
          rise.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p718__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p719__Start"/>Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who
          would sympathize with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one;
          but, I fear, I have gained him only to know his value, and lose him. I would reconcile him
          to life, but he repulses the idea.<p loc="novel1_letter4_p719__End"/>
        <p loc="novel1_letter4_p720__Start"/>“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch;
          but when you speak of new ties, and fresh affections, <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_166" n="162"/>think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was;
          or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any
          superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over
          our minds, which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions,
          which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge
          of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister
          or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shewn early, suspect the
          other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached,
          may, in spite of himself, be invaded with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only 
          <pb xml:id="F1818_v3_167" n="163"/>through habit and association, but from their own
          merits; and, wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth, and the conversation of
          Clerval, will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead; and but one feeling in such a
          solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or
          design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow-creatures, then could I live to fulfil
          it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave
          existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled, and I may die.”<p loc="novel1_letter4_p720__End"/>
