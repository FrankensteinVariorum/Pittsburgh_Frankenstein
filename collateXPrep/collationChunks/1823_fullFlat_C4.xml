   <p>MY DEAR SISTER,</p>
   <p>I write a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well advanced on my voyage. This
          letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on its homeward voyage from Archangel;
          more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am,
          however, in good spirits: my men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose; nor do the
          floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indi<pb xml:id="F1823_v1_038" n="19"/>cating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.
          We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although
          not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores
          which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had
          not expected.</p>
   <p>No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two
          stiff gales, and the breaking of a mast, are accidents which experienced navigators
          scarcely remember to record; and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us
          during our voyage.</p>
   <p>Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not
          rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.</p>
   <p>
      <pb xml:id="F1823_v1_039" n="20"/>Remember me to all my English friends.</p>
   <p>Most affectionately yours,</p>
   <p>R. W.</p>
