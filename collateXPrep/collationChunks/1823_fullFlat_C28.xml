            to embark for Havre. I preferred this plan principally because I dreaded to see again
            those places in which I had enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved
            Clerval. I thought with horror of seeing again those persons whom we had been accustomed
            to visit together, and who might mkae<comment text="ebb: printer error for make"/>
            inquiries concerning an event, the very remembrance of which made me again feel the pang
            I endured <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_453" n="180"/>when I gazed on his lifeless form in the
            inn at——.<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again seeing me
            restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness and attentions were unremitting; my
            grief and gloom was obstinate, but he would not despair. Sometimes he thought that I
            felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he
            endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>“Alas! my father,” said I, “how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings
            and passions, would indeed be degraded, if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor
            unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for
            it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_454" n="181"/>and Henry—they all died by my hands.”<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I
            thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he
            appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some
            idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I
            preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and maintained a continual
            silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a feeling that I should be supposed
            mad, and this for ever chained my tongue, when I would have given the whole world to
            have confided the fatal secret.<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, “What do you
            mean, Victor? <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_455" n="182"/>are you mad? My dear son, I entreat you
            never to make such an assertion again.”<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my
            operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent
            victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood,
            drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
            sacrifice the whole human race.”<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he
            instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and endeavoured to alter the course of
            my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had
            taken place in Ireland, <pb xml:id="F1823_v2_456" n="183"/>and never alluded to them, or
            suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no
            longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the
            consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence, I curbed the imperious voice of
            wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my
            manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the
            sea of ice.<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
          <p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__Start"/>We arrived at Havre on the 8th of May, and instantly proceeded to Paris, where my
            father had some business, which detained us a few weeks. In this city I received the
            following letter from Elizabeth:—<p loc="novel3__letter4__chapter22__End"/>
