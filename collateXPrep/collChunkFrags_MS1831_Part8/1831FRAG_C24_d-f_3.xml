<xml>I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome
    task in my fatherâ€™s house, while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I
    knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would
    disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I
    should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that
    would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself
    from all I loved while thus employed. Once <pb xml:id="F1831_v_150" n="134"/>commenced,
    it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family</xml>
