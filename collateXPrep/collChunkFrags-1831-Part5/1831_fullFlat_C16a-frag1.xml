    beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow
    pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills, to barricade the valley. The abrupt
    sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few
    shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
    presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves, or the fall
    of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche, or the cracking, reverberated
    along the mountains of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of
    immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
    their hands.
