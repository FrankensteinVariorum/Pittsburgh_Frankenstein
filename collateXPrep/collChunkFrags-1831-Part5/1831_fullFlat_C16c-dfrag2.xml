    I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and
    ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the
    day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering
    pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine; the eagle, soaring amidst the
    cloudsâ€”they all gathered round me, and bade me be at peace.<p eID="novel1_letter4_chapter10_div4_div10_p1"/>
    <p sID="novel1_letter4_chapter10_div4_div10_p2"/>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? <pb xml:id="F1831_v_097" n="81"/>All
