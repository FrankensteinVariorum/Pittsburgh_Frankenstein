But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">gay </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">glad </rdg></app>welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?

Victor, he is murdered! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Last Thursday (May <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">7th) </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">7th), </rdg></app>I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">inquired </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">enquired </rdg></app>if we had seen his <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">brother: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">brother; </rdg></app>he said, that <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">they </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">he </rdg></app>had been playing <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">together, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">with him, </rdg></app>that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">night: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">night; </rdg></app>Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer’s finger was on his neck. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">but </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">but: </rdg></app>she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her <app><rdg wit="#f1818">hands, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">hands </rdg></app>exclaimed, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">‘O </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">’O </rdg></app>God! I have <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">murdered </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">murdered: </rdg></app>my darling <app><rdg wit="#f1818">infant!’ </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">infant !’ </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">child!’ </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">teazed </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">teased </rdg></app>her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">William. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">William! </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">festering </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">festering, </rdg></app>the wounds of our minds.

I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">bitterness, “are </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">bitterness,“ are </rdg></app>you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">happened?” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">happened?“ </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he; “your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">raise my spirits. He did not do this by common topics </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">say a few words </rdg></app>of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">consolation, but by exhibiting the truest </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">consolation; he could only express his heartfelt </rdg></app>sympathy. “Poor William!” said he, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">“that dear child; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">“dear lovely child, </rdg></app>he now sleeps with his angel <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">mother. His </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">mother! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How much more a murderer, that could destroy such radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his </rdg></app>friends mourn and weep, but he is at <app><rdg wit="#f1818">rest: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">rest; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever. A </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">he does not now feel the murderer’s grasp; a </rdg></app>sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">fit </rdg></app>subject for pity; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">the survivors are the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the only consolation. Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind of man ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved object, ought not to be urged. Even Cato wept over the dead body of his brother.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">cabriole, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">cabriolet, </rdg></app>and bade farewell to my friend. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">sympathize </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sympathise </rdg></app>with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that <app><rdg wit="#f1818">time? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">time! </rdg></app>One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">calm, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">calm; </rdg></app>and the snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Blanc; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Blanc. </rdg></app>I wept like a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">child: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">child. </rdg></app>“Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">lake! </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">lake. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village <app><rdg wit="#f1831">at the distance of </rdg></app>half a league <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">to the east of </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">from </rdg></app>the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">Savoy; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Savoy ; </rdg></app>vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">everything </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">every thing </rdg></app>seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While I watched the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">storm, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">tempest, </rdg></app>so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, <app><rdg wit="#f1823">: </rdg></app>and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">dirge!” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">dirge! </rdg></app>As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">dæmon, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">dæmon </rdg></app>to whom I had given life. What did he <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">there? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">there ? </rdg></app>Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed that fair child. &lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;He&lt;/hi&gt; was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">of </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">ot </rdg></app>the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I remained motionless. The <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">thunder </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">thunde </rdg></app>ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of my own hands alive at my <app><rdg wit="#f1818">bed-side; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">bed side; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">bedside; </rdg></app>its departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were <app><rdg wit="#f1818">open; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">open, </rdg></app>and I hastened to my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">father’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">father's </rdg></app>house. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">My </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">My. </rdg></app>first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Besides, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">And then </rdg></app>of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">Mont </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Mount </rdg></app>Salêve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was about five in the morning when I entered my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">father’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">father's </rdg></app>house. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">respectable </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">venerable </rdg></app>parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">mantlepiece. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mantelpiece. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">mantel-piece. </rdg></app>It was an historical subject, painted at my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">father’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">father's </rdg></app>desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me. He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: “Welcome, my dearest <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">Victor,” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Victor,“ </rdg></app>said he. “Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">But we are now unhappy; and, I am afraid, tears instead of smiles will be your welcome. Our father looks so sorrowful: this dreadful event seems </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">You come to us now </rdg></app>to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">have revived in his mind his grief on the death of </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">Mamma. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mamma. </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Poor </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">Elizabeth also </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Elizabeth, also, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">is quite inconsolable.” Ernest began to weep as he said these words. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Do not,” said I, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">“welcome </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">“ Welcome </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">me thus; try to be more calm, that I may not be absolutely miserable the moment </rdg></app>I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">enter my father’s house after so long an absence. But, tell me, how does my father support </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under </rdg></app>his <app><rdg wit="#f1818">misfortunes? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">misfortunes ? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and her I named my cousin. </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and how is my poor Elizabeth?” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “She <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">indeed requires </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">most of all,” said Ernest, “requires </rdg></app>consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">discovered—” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">discovered——” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? <app><rdg wit="#f1818">it </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">It </rdg></app>is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">straw.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I do not know what you <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">mean; but we were all very unhappy when she was discovered. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">mean,” replied my brother, in accents of wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. </rdg></app>No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">all at once become </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">suddenly become capable of </rdg></app>so <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">extremely wicked?” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">frightful, so appalling a crime?” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon <app><rdg wit="#f1818">us: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">us; </rdg></app>and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried to-day, and you will then hear all.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">bed; and, after </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">bed for </rdg></app>several <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">days, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">days. During this interval, </rdg></app>one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">my </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">my. </rdg></app>mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly <app><rdg wit="#f1818">shewed </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">showed </rdg></app>it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">innocent.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">innocent." </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, “Good God, <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Papa! </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">papa! </rdg></app>Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father; “for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one I valued so highly.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “My dear father, you are <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">mistaken; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mistaken ; </rdg></app>Justine is innocent.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">to-day, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">today, </rdg></app>and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">her; and, in this assurance, I calmed myself, expecting the trial with eagerness, but without prognosticating an evil result. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world? </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">made great alterations in her form </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">altered her </rdg></app>since <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">I had last </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I last </rdg></app>beheld <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">her. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">Six </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">.Six </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">years before she had been a pretty, good-humoured girl, whom every one loved and caressed. She was now a woman in stature and expression of countenance, which was uncommonly lovely. An open and capacious forehead gave indications of a good understanding, joined to great frankness of disposition. Her eyes were hazel, and expressive of mildness, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">now </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">now, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">through recent </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">affliction </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">affliction, </rdg></app>allied to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">sadness. Her hair was of a rich dark auburn, her complexion fair, and her figure slight and graceful. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. </rdg></app>She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. <app><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;comment&gt; ebb: Typesetter error: the period is missing at the end of the previous sentence which also comes at the end of a line . &lt;/comment&gt; </rdg></app>Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">acquittal.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">acquittal” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “How kind <app><rdg wit="#f1831">and generous </rdg></app>you are! every one else believes in her guilt, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">and that made me </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">and.that made me </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">wretched; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">wretched, </rdg></app>for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a <app><rdg wit="#f1818">manner, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">manner </rdg></app>rendered me hopeless and despairing.” She wept. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">“Sweet </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">“Dearest </rdg></app>niece,” said my father, “dry your tears.
