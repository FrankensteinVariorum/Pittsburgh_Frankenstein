He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">misery </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">misery, </rdg></app>without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">employments </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">projects </rdg></app>of others. He has <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">asked me many questions concerning my design; and I have related my little history frankly to him. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. </rdg></app>He <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">appeared pleased with the confidence, and suggested several alterations in my plan, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success, and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge </rdg></app>which I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">shall find exceedingly useful. There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does appears </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sought; for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I perceived that he tried </rdg></app>to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">spring solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the welfare of those who surround him. He is often overcome by gloom, and then he sits by himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen or unsocial in his humour. These paroxysms pass </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes; and my voice quivered and failed me, as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers,—a groan burst </rdg></app>from <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">him like a cloud from before </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">his heaving breast. I paused; —at length he spoke, in broken accents:—“Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drank also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me,—let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Having conquered </rdg></app>the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">sun, though his dejection never leaves him. I have endeavoured to win his confidence; and I trust that I have succeeded. One day I mentioned to him the </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told: but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my </rdg></app>desire <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">I had always felt </rdg></app>of finding a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">friend who might </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">friend—of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot; and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness, who </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">sympathize </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">sympathise </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">with me, and direct me by his counsel. I said, I </rdg></app>did not <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">belong to that class of men who are offended by advice. “I am self-educated, and perhaps I hardly rely sufficiently upon my own powers. I </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">enjoy this blessing. </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">wish therefore </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">wish, therefore, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">that my companion should be wiser and more experienced than myself, to confirm and support me; nor have I believed it impossible to find a true friend.” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I agree with you,” replied the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">stranger, “in believing that friendship is not only a desirable, but a possible acquisition. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">stranger; “we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. </rdg></app>I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost every thing, and cannot begin life anew.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief, that touched me to the heart. But he was silent, and presently retired to his cabin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">yet </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">yet, </rdg></app>when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Will you <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">laugh </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">smile </rdg></app>at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">If you do, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">You would not, if </rdg></app>you <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">must have certainly lost that simplicity which was once your characteristic charm. Yet, if you will, smile at the warmth of my expressions, while I find every day new </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore, somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses, that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment; a quick but never-failing power of judgment; a penetration into the </rdg></app>causes <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">for repeating them. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression, and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; August <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">19th, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">19. </rdg></app>17—. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">once, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">at one time, </rdg></app>that the memory of these evils should die with me; but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">misfortunes </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">disasters </rdg></app>will be useful to <app><rdg wit="#f1818">you, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">you; </rdg></app>yet, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">if </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">when I reflect that </rdg></app>you are <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">inclined, listen to my tale. I believe that the strange incidents connected with it will afford a view </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale; one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking, and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes </rdg></app>of nature, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">which may enlarge your faculties and understanding. You will hear of </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions, which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied </rdg></app>powers <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and occurrences, such as you have been accustomed to believe impossible: but I do not </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">of nature:—nor can I </rdg></app>doubt <app><rdg wit="#f1831">but </rdg></app>that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You may easily <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">conceive </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">imagine </rdg></app>that I was much gratified by the offered communication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is <app><rdg wit="#f1818">determined. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">determined.” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">engaged, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">imperatively occupied by my duties, </rdg></app>to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">you </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">von </rdg></app>the greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;head&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story; frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course, and wrecked it—thus! &lt;/p&gt; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">&lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;FRANKENSTEIN; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">FRANKENSTEIN; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;head&gt; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;hi rend="smallcaps"&gt;OR&lt;/hi&gt;, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1823">&lt;/head&gt; &lt;head&gt; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">THE MODERN </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">PROMETHEUS.&lt;/hi&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">PROMETHEUS. </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/head&gt; </rdg></app>&lt;comment&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">RM: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">ebb: </rdg></app>centered <app><rdg wit="#f1818">ornamental </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">underscore a few lines below </rdg></app>&lt;/comment&gt; </p>
