In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">health, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">health </rdg></app>the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">but, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">but </rdg></app>not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my <app><rdg wit="#f1818">improvement </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">improvement, </rdg></app>to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew <app><rdg wit="#f1818">nobounds, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">no bounds, </rdg></app>yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Aye, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Ay, </rdg></app>stare if you please; but it is <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">nevertheless </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">nevertheeless </rdg></app>true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed <app><rdg wit="#f1831">in </rdg></app>Cornelius <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">Agrippa </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Agrippa, </rdg></app>as firmly as <app><rdg wit="#f1831">in </rdg></app>the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">countenance.—Aye, aye,” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">countenance.—Ay, ay,” </rdg></app>continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, “M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Clerval; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Clerval: </rdg></app>I was myself when <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">young; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">young: </rdg></app>but that wears out in a very short time.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Clerval <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">was no </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">had never sympathised in my tastes for </rdg></app>natural <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">philosopher. His imagination was too vivid for the </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, as thus he should </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">minutiae </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">minutæ </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">of science. Languages were his principal study; and he sought, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">but </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">by </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">acquiring their elements, to </rdg></app>open a field for <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">self-instruction on </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for </rdg></app>his <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">return to Geneva. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">spirit of enterprise. The </rdg></app>Persian, Arabic, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Hebrew, gained </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Sanscrit languages engaged </rdg></app>his attention, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">after he had made himself perfectly master of Greek and Latin. For my own part, idleness </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness </rdg></app>had ever been irksome to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">me, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">me; </rdg></app>and now that I <app><rdg wit="#f1818">wishedto </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">wished to </rdg></app>fly from <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">reflection, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">reflection </rdg></app>and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. <app><rdg wit="#f1831">I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. </rdg></app>Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">elevating </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">elevating, </rdg></app>to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and <app><rdg wit="#f1831">a </rdg></app>garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Rome. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Rome! </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing <app><rdg wit="#f1818">spring.I </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">spring. I </rdg></app>felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">town, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">town </rdg></app>and my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">long </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">long, </rdg></app>from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it <app><rdg wit="#f1818">came, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">came </rdg></app>its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Ingolstadt </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Ingolstadt, </rdg></app>that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We passed a fortnight in these <app><rdg wit="#f1818">perambulations; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">perambulations: </rdg></app>my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">me </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">ine </rdg></app>unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to elevate my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">mind, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">mind </rdg></app>until it was on a level with your <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">own. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">own! </rdg></app>A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">loving </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">loved </rdg></app>and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">in </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">inbud: </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">bud: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">bud. </rdg></app>I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">sympathized </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sympathised </rdg></app>in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="5" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;comment&gt; ebb: centered underscore a few lines below &lt;/comment&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="6" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
