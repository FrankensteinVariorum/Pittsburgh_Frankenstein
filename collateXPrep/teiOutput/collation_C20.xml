It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">did </rdg></app>a number of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">circumstances </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">circumstances, </rdg></app>each <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">interesting </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">interesting, </rdg></app>and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors, and beloved by <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">his </rdg></app>equals. His son was bred in the service of his country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a large and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant, and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried, and condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime alleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Felix had <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">accidentally </rdg></app>been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan; who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night, and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt; yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind, that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer; yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to <app><rdg wit="#f1818">that </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">the </rdg></app>consummation of his happiness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her <app><rdg wit="#f1818">father’s, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">father, </rdg></app>who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her <app><rdg wit="#f1818">father; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">parent; </rdg></app>and at the same time <app><rdg wit="#f1818">deeply </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">she gently </rdg></app>deplored her own fate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart, I will give them to you, they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Safie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">Safie, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Satie, </rdg></app>who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in <app><rdg wit="#f1818">freedom </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">freedom, </rdg></app>spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female followers of Mahomet. This lady died; but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">the </rdg></app>being immured within the walls of a haram, allowed only to occupy herself with <app><rdg wit="#f1818">puerile </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">infantile </rdg></app>amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian, and remaining in a country where <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">women </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">Women </rdg></app>were allowed to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">take </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">fake </rdg></app>a rank in society, was enchanting to her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night previous to it, he <app><rdg wit="#f1818">had </rdg></app>quitted <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">his </rdg></app>prison, and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Safie resolved to remain with her father until <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">the </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">this </rdg></app>moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian; but he feared the resentment of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Felix </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Felix, </rdg></app>if he should appear lukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer, if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans were <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">greatly </rdg></app>facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim, and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix, and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister, lay in a noisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Turk, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Turks, </rdg></app>that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune, and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">andimpotence, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">and ruin, </rdg></app>became a traitor to good feeling and honour, and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">money </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">money, </rdg></app>to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have endured <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">poverty, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">poverty; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">and when </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and while </rdg></app>this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he <app><rdg wit="#f1818">would have </rdg></app>gloried in it: but the ingratitude of the Turk, and the loss of his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “When the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return <app><rdg wit="#f1818">with him </rdg></app>to her native country. The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment, and told her hastily, that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">had </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">bad </rdg></app>been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">consequently, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">consequently </rdg></app>hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike adverse to it. By some papers of her <app><rdg wit="#f1818">father’s, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">father, </rdg></app>which fell into her hands, she heard of the exile of her lover, and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her, and a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">small </rdg></app>sum of money, she quitted <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Italy, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Italy </rdg></app>with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">fell </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">tell </rdg></app>dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection; but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country, and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound; and, after her death, the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="13" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;comment&gt; ebb: centered underscore a few lines below &lt;/comment&gt;&lt;milestone n="14" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
