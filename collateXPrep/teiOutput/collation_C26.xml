As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart, and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being, of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate, and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth, who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">a </rdg></app>right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats: but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">price perhaps </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">price, perhaps, </rdg></app>of the existence of the whole human race. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw, by the light of the moon, the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress, and claim the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">fulfillment </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">fulfilment </rdg></app>of my promise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like <app><rdg wit="#f1818">him, and, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">to him, and </rdg></app>trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">saw </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">saW </rdg></app>me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">left </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">left, </rdg></app>the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Several hours <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">passed, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">past, </rdg></app>and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices, as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and wished </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">andwished </rdg></app>to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me, and said, in a smothered voice— &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands, and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England, and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">wickedness.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">wickedness. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;—obey!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “The hour of my <app><rdg wit="#f1818">weakness </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">irresolution </rdg></app>is past, and the period of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a <app><rdg wit="#f1818">resolution </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">determination </rdg></app>of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon, whose delight is in death and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">wretchedness. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">wretchedness? </rdg></app>Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Man, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Man! </rdg></app>you may hate; but beware! <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Your </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">your </rdg></app>hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever. Are you to be happy, while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You can blast my other passions; but revenge remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die; but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I started forward, and exclaimed, “Villain! before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house with <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">precipitation: in </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">precipitation. In </rdg></app>a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy <app><rdg wit="#f1818">swiftness </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">swiftness, </rdg></app>and was soon lost amidst the waves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears. I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him, and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the main land. I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his words—“&lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;I will be with you on your <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">wedding-night&lt;/hi&gt;.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">wedding-night.&lt;/hi&gt;” </rdg></app>That then was the period fixed for the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">fulfillment </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">fulfilment </rdg></app>of my destiny. In that hour I should die, and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth,—of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her,—tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness, when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">wearily </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">wearily, </rdg></app>it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed, or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom I had myself created. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved, and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass, and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sunk refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rung in my ears like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">fishing-boat </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">fishingboat </rdg></app>land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval, entreating me to join him. He said that <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">nearly a year had </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">he </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">elapsed </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">elapse </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">since we had quitted Switzerland, and France </rdg></app>was <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">yet unvisited. He </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was; that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he </rdg></app>entreated <app><rdg wit="#f1831">me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought </rdg></app>me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle, and <app><rdg wit="#f1831">to </rdg></app>meet him at Perth, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">in a week from </rdg></app>that <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">time, when </rdg></app>we might <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">arrange the plan of our future proceedings. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">proceed southwards together. </rdg></app>This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect: I must pack <app><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">up </rdg></app>my chemical instruments; and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils, the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">day-break, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">daybreak, </rdg></app>I summoned sufficient courage, and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself, and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">peasants, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">peasants; </rdg></app>and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, <app><rdg wit="#f1818">and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and, </rdg></app>laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair, as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes, and that I, for the first time, saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow-creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">sea; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">sea: </rdg></app>I listened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by the north-east breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me, and filled me with such agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my stay on the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">water, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">water; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and, </rdg></app>fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, every thing was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course, but quickly found <app><rdg wit="#f1818">that </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">that, </rdg></app>if I again made the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">attempt </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">attempt, </rdg></app>the boat would be instantly filled <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">with </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">With </rdg></app>water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me, and was so <app><rdg wit="#f1818">little </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">slenderly </rdg></app>acquainted with the geography of this part of the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">world </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">world, </rdg></app>that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic, and feel all the tortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours, and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">wind </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">wind, </rdg></app>only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the sea, it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and sunk </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me </rdg></app>into a reverie, so despairing and frightful, that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy <app><rdg wit="#f1818">swell; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">swell: </rdg></app>I felt sick, and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">misery! </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">misery ! </rdg></app>I constructed another sail with a part of my dress, and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance; but, as I approached nearer, I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore, and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">civilized </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">civilised </rdg></app>man. I <app><rdg wit="#f1818">eagerly </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">carefully </rdg></app>traced the windings of the land, and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">town </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">town, </rdg></app>as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory, I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot. They seemed <app><rdg wit="#f1818">very </rdg></app>much surprised at my appearance; but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English; and I therefore addressed them in that language: <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">“My </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">My </rdg></app>good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town, and inform me where I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">am?” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">am ?” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a <app><rdg wit="#f1818">gruff </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">hoarse </rdg></app>voice. <app><rdg wit="#f1823">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; </rdg></app>“May be you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste; but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger; and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so roughly?” I <app><rdg wit="#f1818">replied: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">replied; </rdg></app>“surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the English may be; but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed, and in some degree alarmed me. I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">inquired </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">enquired </rdg></app>the way to the inn; but no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me; when an ill-looking man approaching, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, “Come, Sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s, to give an account of yourself.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free country?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Ay, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Sir, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sir, </rdg></app>free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate; and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This answer startled me; but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved: accordingly I followed my conductor in silence, and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger; but, being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">debility </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">debilily </rdg></app>might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me, and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I must pause <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">here; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">here ; </rdg></app>for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="19" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="20" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
