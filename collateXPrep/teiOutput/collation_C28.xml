We landed, and proceeded to Paris. </rdg></app>I <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">preferred this plan principally because I dreaded to see again those places in which </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">soon found that </rdg></app>I had <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">enjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved Clerval. I thought with horror of seeing again those persons whom we had been accustomed to visit together, and who might </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">overtaxed my strength, and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father’s care </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">make </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mkae </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">inquiries concerning an event, the very remembrance of which made me again feel the pang I endured when I gazed on his lifeless form in the inn </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">at——. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">at ——. </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again seeing me restored to health and peace of mind. His tenderness </rdg></app>and attentions were <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">unremitting; my grief and gloom was obstinate, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">indefatigable; </rdg></app>but he <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">would </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">did </rdg></app>not <app><rdg wit="#f1831">know the origin of my sufferings, and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them, whose joy it was to shed their blood, and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me, and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts, and the crimes which had their source in me! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society, and strove by various arguments to banish my </rdg></app>despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Alas! my father,” said I, “how <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">little </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">little, </rdg></app>do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">degraded, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">degraded </rdg></app>if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by my hands.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as <app><rdg wit="#f1818">caused by </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">the offspring of </rdg></app>delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation, and maintained <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">a </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">a, </rdg></app>continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">feeling </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">persuasion </rdg></app>that I should be supposed <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">mad, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">mad; </rdg></app>and this <app><rdg wit="#f1831">in itself would </rdg></app>for ever <app><rdg wit="#f1831">have </rdg></app>chained my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">tongue, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation, and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy, and was silent </rdg></app>when I would have given the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">whole </rdg></app>world to have confided the fatal secret. <app><rdg wit="#f1818">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Yet still words like those I have recorded, would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them; but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">“What do you mean, Victor? are you mad? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? </rdg></app>My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">endeavoured </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">endeavored </rdg></app>to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">the </rdg></app>scenes that had taken place in Ireland, and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence, I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">We arrived at Havre on the 8th of May, and instantly proceeded to Paris, where my father had some </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">A </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">business </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">busines, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">which detained us a </rdg></app>few <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">weeks. In this </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">city, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">city </rdg></app>I received the following letter from Elizabeth:— &lt;/p&gt; </p>
