My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of <app><rdg wit="#f1818">justice, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">justice </rdg></app>I suffered living torture. It was to be decided, whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of innocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave; and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman, and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning; and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands; for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court, she threw her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The trial began; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and, </rdg></app>after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered any one who had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed, and towards morning had been perceived by a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">market-woman </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">marketwoman </rdg></app>not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o’clock; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">and, </rdg></app>when one <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">inquired </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">enquired </rdg></app>where she had passed the night, she <app><rdg wit="#f1818">replied, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">replied </rdg></app>that she had been looking for the child, and demanded <app><rdg wit="#f1818">earnestly, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">earnestly </rdg></app>if any thing had been heard concerning him. When <app><rdg wit="#f1818">shewn </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">shown </rdg></app>the body, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then produced, which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">misery, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">misery </rdg></app>were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">but </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">but, </rdg></app>when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">spoke </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">spoke, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">in an audible </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">in an audible, </rdg></app>although <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">variable </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">variable, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">voice:— </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">voice. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me; and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation, where any circumstance appears doubtful or <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">suspicious.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">suspicious” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been <app><rdg wit="#f1818">committed, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">committed </rdg></app>at the house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man, who asked her if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Unable to rest or sleep, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and </rdg></app>she quitted her <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">asylum early, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">asylum, </rdg></app>that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">market-woman, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">marketwoman </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">market-woman </rdg></app>was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">there? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">there ? </rdg></app>I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; <app><rdg wit="#f1818">or </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">or, </rdg></app>if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">hope. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">hope, </rdg></app>I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Several witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty, rendered them timorous, and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">violently </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">'violently </rdg></app>agitated, she desired permission to address the court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated <app><rdg wit="#f1818">by </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">by, </rdg></app>and have lived with his parents ever since and even long <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">before </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">before, </rdg></app>his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five, and at another for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last <app><rdg wit="#f1818">illness </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">illness, </rdg></app>with the greatest affection and care; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">and afterwards </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">andafterwards </rdg></app>attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">her. After </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">her; after </rdg></app>which she again lived in my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">uncle’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">uncle's </rdg></app>house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead, and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so much do I esteem and value her.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Excellent Elizabeth! </rdg></app>A murmur of approbation <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">was heard; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful appeal; </rdg></app>but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">favor </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">favour </rdg></app>of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon, who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">ignominy? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">ignominy. </rdg></app>I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I perceived that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges, had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">mine; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mine ; </rdg></app>she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would not forego their hold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt. “That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">When I returned </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes deceived me? and was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be, if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return </rdg></app>home, <app><rdg wit="#f1831">and </rdg></app>Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty should escape. But she has <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">confessed.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">confessed. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she, “how shall I ever again believe in human <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">benevolence? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">goodness? </rdg></app>Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">betray; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">betray? </rdg></app>her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or <app><rdg wit="#f1818">ill-humour, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">ill humour, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">guile, </rdg></app>and yet she has committed a murder.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">wish </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">desire </rdg></app>to see my cousin. My father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth, “I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">further </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">farther </rdg></app>end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Oh, Justine!” said she, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">“why </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">why </rdg></app>did you rob me of my last <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">consolation? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">consolation. </rdg></app>I relied on your innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “And do you also believe that I am so very, very <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">wicked? </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">wicked ? </rdg></app>Do you also join with my enemies to crush <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">me?” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">me, to condemn me as a murderer?” </rdg></app>Her voice was suffocated with sobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth, “why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I did confess; but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments, if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She paused, weeping, and then continued—“I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Oh, Justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">my dear girl; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">dear girl. Do not fear. </rdg></app>I will <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">every where proclaim </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">proclaim, I will prove </rdg></app>your <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">innocence, and force belief. Yet you must die; you, my playfellow, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!—You, my play-fellow, </rdg></app>my companion, my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">more than sister. I never can </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sister, perish on the scaffold! No! no! I never could </rdg></app>survive so horrible a misfortune.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">“Dear, sweet Elizabeth, do not weep. You ought to raise me with thoughts of a better life, and elevate me from the petty cares of this world of injustice and strife. Do not you, excellent friend, drive me to despair.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and poignant to admit of consolation, for there is no hope. Yet heaven bless thee, my dearest Justine, with resignation, and a confidence elevated beyond this world. Oh! how I hate its </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said; “that pang </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">shews </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">shows </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and mockeries! when one creature is murdered, another is immediately deprived of life in a slow torturing manner; then the executioners, their hands yet reeking with the blood of innocence, believe that they have done a great deed. They </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">call </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">call, </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">this &lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;retribution&lt;/hi&gt;. Hateful name! When that word is pronounced, I know greater and more horrid punishments are going to be inflicted than the gloomiest tyrant has ever invented to satiate his utmost revenge. Yet this </rdg></app>is <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">not consolation for you, my Justine, unless indeed that you may glory in escaping from so miserable a den. Alas! I would I were in peace with my aunt and my lovely William, escaped from a world which is hateful to </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">past. God raises my weakness, and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember </rdg></app>me, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">the visages </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">think of me as </rdg></app>of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">men which I abhor.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Justine smiled languidly. “This, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, </rdg></app>dear lady, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">is despair, and not resignation. I must not learn the lesson that you would teach me. Talk of something else, something that will bring peace, and not increase of misery.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">to submit in patience to the will of Heaven!” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared <app><rdg wit="#f1818">talked </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">talk </rdg></app>of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">dreary </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">awful </rdg></app>boundary between life and death, felt not as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she approached me, and said, “Dear <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Sir, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">sir, </rdg></app>you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">guilty.” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">guilty?” </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more convinced of your innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but her’s also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">hides, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">hides </rdg></app>but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me, which nothing could extinguish. We <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">staid </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">stayed </rdg></app>several hours with Justine; and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">heaven </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Heaven, </rdg></app>in its <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">bounty </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">bounty, </rdg></app>bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">suffer. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">suffer! </rdg></app>Live, and be happy, and make others so.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">As we returned, Elizabeth said, “You know not, my dear Victor, how much I am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this unfortunate girl. I never could again have known peace, if I had been deceived in my reliance </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers, and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away </rdg></app>on <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">her. For the moment that I did believe her guilty, I felt an anguish that I could not have long sustained. Now my heart </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home—all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones; but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
