Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">fellow-men; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">fellow men; </rdg></app>this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive, and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was <app><rdg wit="#f1831">also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonisation and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. He was </rdg></app>for ever busy; and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected <app><rdg wit="#f1818">mien. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">mind. </rdg></app>I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to <app><rdg wit="#f1818">one </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">one, </rdg></app>who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland, who had formerly been our <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">visitor </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">visiter </rdg></app>at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country, and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">mountaineers; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mountaineers ; </rdg></app>the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Gower, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Goring, </rdg></app>his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by &lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;ennui&lt;/hi&gt;, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart, and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">abhorrent </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">intolerable </rdg></app>to myself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">fears </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">fears, </rdg></app>to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">self-sacrifice, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">self sacrifice, </rdg></app>of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but <app><rdg wit="#f1818">everything </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">every thing </rdg></app>is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps, which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave, and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble, when pronounced by Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; From <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Derby </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Derby, </rdg></app>still journeying northward, we passed two months in Cumberland and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Westmoreland. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Westmorland. </rdg></app>I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">proportionably </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">proportionally </rdg></app>greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">here,” </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">here, </rdg></app>said he to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and <app><rdg wit="#f1818">Westmoreland, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">Westmorland, </rdg></app>and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived, and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me, and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Oxford; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Oxford: </rdg></app>for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle, and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Andrews, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Andrew’s, </rdg></app>and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">rendezvous. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">rendezvous, </rdg></app>I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Having parted from my friend, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">I </rdg></app>determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland, and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">of my </rdg></app>labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock, whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the main land, which was about five miles distant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">but </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">hut </rdg></app>two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession; an incident which would, doubtless, have occasioned some surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea, to listen to <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">the </rdg></app>waves as they <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">roared, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">roared </rdg></app>and dashed at my feet. It was a <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">monotonous, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">monotonous </rdg></app>yet <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">ever-changing </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">everchanging </rdg></app>scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant, when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but, as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days; and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">was indeed </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">was, indeed, </rdg></app>a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the <app><rdg wit="#f1818">sequel </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">consummation </rdg></app>of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">them </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">them, </rdg></app>lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow-creatures, lest when alone he should come to claim his companion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question, but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="18" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="19" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
