Justine died; she rested; and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart, which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">mischief beyond </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">mischiefbeyond </rdg></app>description horrible, and more, much <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">more, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">more </rdg></app>(I persuaded <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">myself) </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">myself), </rdg></app>was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness, and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice, and make myself useful to my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">fellow-beings. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">fellowbeings. </rdg></app>Now all was blasted: instead of that serenity of conscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures, such as no language can describe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had <app><rdg wit="#f1831">perhaps never </rdg></app>entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only <app><rdg wit="#f1818">consolation——deep, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">consolation—deep, </rdg></app>dark, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">death-like </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">deathlike </rdg></app>solitude. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits, and endeavoured <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">to reason with me on the folly of giving way to immoderate grief. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life, to inspire me with fortitude, and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. </rdg></app>“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother;” (tears came into his eyes as he <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">spoke); </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">spoke;) </rdg></app>“but is it not a duty to the survivors, that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself; for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if remorse had not mingled its <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">bitterness </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">bitterness, and terror its alarm </rdg></app>with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair, and endeavour to hide myself from his view. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o’clock, and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour, had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat, and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">heavenly, if </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">heavenly—if </rdg></app>I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father, and surviving brother: should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">unprotected </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">unprotected, </rdg></app>to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils; and I lived in daily fear, lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over, and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear, so long as <app><rdg wit="#f1818">anything </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">any thing </rdg></app>I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him, I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">anger </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">abhorrence </rdg></app>on his head, and avenge the deaths of William and Justine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Our house was the house of mourning. My <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">father’s </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">father's </rdg></app>health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature, who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">ecstasy </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">ecstacy </rdg></app>of our future prospects. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">She had become grave, and often conversed of the inconstancy of fortune, and the instability of human life. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth, had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles. </rdg></app>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice, that I read in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Every body believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being; but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Yet </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">But </rdg></app>she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel <app><rdg wit="#f1823">as </rdg></app>if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my <app><rdg wit="#f1818">hand </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">hand, </rdg></app>said, “My dearest <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">cousin, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">friend, </rdg></app>you must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Be calm, my dear Victor; I would sacrifice my life to </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! while we love—while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, </rdg></app>your <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">peace. We surely shall be happy: quiet in our </rdg></app>native country, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">and not mingling in the world, what </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">we may reap every tranquil blessing,—what </rdg></app>can disturb our <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">tranquillity?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She shed tears as she said this, distrusting the very solace that she gave; but at the same time she smiled, that she might </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">peace?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune, suffice to </rdg></app>chase away the fiend that lurked in my <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">heart. My father, who saw in the unhappiness that was painted in my face only an exaggeration of that sorrow which I might naturally feel, thought that an amusement suited to my taste would be the best means of restoring to me my wonted serenity. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror; lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe: the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die—was but a type of me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me: but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. </rdg></app>It was <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">from this cause that he had removed to the country; and, induced by the same motive, he now proposed that we should all make an excursion to </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards </rdg></app>the valley of Chamounix. I had <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">been there before, but Elizabeth and Ernest never had; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: &lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;I&lt;/hi&gt; was a wreck—but nought had changed in those savage </rdg></app>and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">both had often expressed an earnest desire to see the scenery of this place, which had been described to them </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">enduring scenes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule, </rdg></app>as <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">so wonderful and </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">the more sure-footed, and least liable to receive injury </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">sublime. </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">sublime; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Accordingly we departed from Geneva </rdg></app>on <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">this tour </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">these rugged roads. The weather was fine: it was </rdg></app>about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Justine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The weather was uncommonly fine; and if mine had been a sorrow to be chased away by any fleeting circumstance, this excursion would certainly have had the effect intended by my father. As it was, I was somewhat interested in the scene; it sometimes lulled, although it could not extinguish my grief. During the first day we travelled in a carriage. In the morning we had seen the mountains at a distance, towards which we gradually advanced. We perceived that the valley through which we wound, and which was formed by the river Arve, whose course we followed, closed in upon us by degrees; and when the sun had set, we beheld </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Justine; that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The </rdg></app>immense mountains and precipices <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">overhanging us </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">that overhung me </rdg></app>on every <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">side, and heard the </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">side—the </rdg></app>sound of the river raging among <app><rdg wit="#f1831">the </rdg></app>rocks, and the dashing of <app><rdg wit="#f1823">water-falls </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">the </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1831">waterfalls </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">around. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The next day we pursued our journey upon mules; and as we </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">around, spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear, or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I </rdg></app>ascended <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">still </rdg></app>higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">We </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I </rdg></app>passed the bridge of <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Pelissier, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Pélissier, </rdg></app>where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">us, and we </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">me, and I </rdg></app>began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">we </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I </rdg></app>entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so <app><rdg wit="#f1818">beautifuland </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823 #f1831">beautiful and </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">picturesque </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">picturesque, </rdg></app>as that of Servox, through which <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">we </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I </rdg></app>had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries; but <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">we </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I </rdg></app>saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">we </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">I </rdg></app>heard the rumbling thunder of the falling <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">avelânche, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">avalanche, </rdg></app>and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding &lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;aiguilles&lt;/hi&gt;, and its tremendous <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">&lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;dome&lt;/hi&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;dôme&lt;/hi&gt; </rdg></app>overlooked the valley. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">During </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during </rdg></app>this <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">journey, I sometimes joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself to point out to her the various beauties of the scene. I often suffered my mule to lag behind, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the light-hearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief, </rdg></app>and <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">indulged in </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">indulging in all </rdg></app>the misery of reflection. <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">At other times </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">Then </rdg></app>I spurred on <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">the animal before my companions, that I might </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">my animal, striving so to </rdg></app>forget <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">them, </rdg></app>the world, <app><rdg wit="#f1831">my fears, </rdg></app>and, more than all, <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">myself. When at a distance, </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, </rdg></app>I alighted, and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair. <app><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; </rdg></app>At <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">eight in the evening </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">length </rdg></app>I arrived at <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">Chamounix. My father and Elizabeth were very much fatigued; Ernest, who accompanied us, was delighted, and in high </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a short space of time </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818">spirits: </rdg><rdg wit="#f1823">spirits; </rdg></app><app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">the only circumstance that detracted from his pleasure was the south wind, and the rain it seemed to promise for the next day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not. </rdg></app>I remained <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">many hours </rdg></app>at the window, watching the pallid <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">lightning </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">lightnings </rdg></app>that played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">ran </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations: when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came, and blest the giver of oblivion. &lt;comment&gt; ebb: centered underscore a few lines </rdg></app>below <app><rdg wit="#f1818 #f1823">my window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="8" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg><rdg wit="#f1831">&lt;/comment&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;milestone n="9" type="end" unit="chapter"/&gt; </rdg></app></p>
