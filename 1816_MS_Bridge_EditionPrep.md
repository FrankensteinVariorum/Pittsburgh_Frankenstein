# Preparing "Bridge" Edition of 1816 Frankenstein Notebooks

This describes our alterations to the Shelley-Godwin Notebooks XML files to make it possible to collate them with the other Frankenstein editions we are preparing. Because the S-GA Notebook files represent diplomatic encoding of each notebook page, S-GA does not mark when words and "streams" of text are broken by lineation, so we are adding explicit markup to help us constitute the semantic flow of the text. We are also resequencing the text as needed to establish the reading order, and this is aided by S-GA's markup of insertion points for marginal additions. Here is an outline of the process:

Here is a summary of changes we are making in our "Pittsburgh bridge" edition of the S-GA notebook files for the purposes of collation. All such work is taking place in collateXPrep --> sga_notebooks directory. 

1) We are marking words broken at ends of lines using `<w>` elements as "milestone markers" with  `<w ana="start"/>` and `<w ana="end"/>`. When there are hyphens marking broken words, we are deleting these (as pseudomarkup) so they do not interfere with collation. For the purposes of collation the construction `<w ana="start"/>emu-<lb/>late<w ana="end"/>` is identical to `<w ana="start"/>emu<lb/>late<w ana="end"/>` and `emulate`. 
2) Where necessary to disentangle positional transcription (as on c57-0031.10 or http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/sc/oxford/ms_abinger/c57/#/p31 ), we are manually moving interlinear additions broken and disrupted by lineation into sequence to prioritize the semantic flow of the text. (These are alterations not marked in margin zones, for which see 3 below.) All such manual alterations are documented on location in dated XML comment tags in the files  [msCollPrep_c56.xml](https://github.com/ebeshero/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/blob/master/collateXPrep/sga_Notebooks/msCollPrep_c56.xml), [msCollPrep_c57.xml](https://github.com/ebeshero/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/blob/master/collateXPrep/sga_Notebooks/msCollPrep_c57.xml), and [msCollPrep_c58.xml](https://github.com/ebeshero/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/blob/master/collateXPrep/sga_Notebooks/msCollPrep_c58.xml)
3) With an XSLT pipeline we are migrating the markup transcribing margin zones into position at their marked insertion points. (This is facilitated by S-GA's location indicators.)
4) With another XSLT we are "flattening" `<line>....</line>` elements to `<lb/>` elements, to preserve these for information about their location. We also run XSLT to "flag" the specific location of each line on its page to facilitate stand-off pointers to S-GA files.
