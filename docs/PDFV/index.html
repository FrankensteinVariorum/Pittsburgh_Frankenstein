						<h2>About the project</h2>

						<p>In the fall of 2016, a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) joined together with a goal to prepare an updated and improved digital edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, conformant with current TEI P5 standard. In October 2016, Elisa Beshero-Bondar met with Raffaele Viglianti and Rikk Mulligan to discuss a strategy for updating the Frankenstein edition on Romantic Circles. Viglianti and Beshero-Bondar subsequently met over Skype with Neil Fraistat and Dave Rettenmaier and agreed that by May of 2018 we would prepare a new edition to update the one currently published on Romantic Circles, MITHâ€™s refereed website on scholarly editions from the British Romantic era. Romantic Circles. Fraistat indicated that currently Frankenstein is by far the most clicked-on text in the Romantic Circles archive, so this is a site of high visibility. We initially agreed to improve the existing edition by collating the 1818 and 1831 editions, which are currently saved in two separate files and compared by viewing in Juxta Commons. We aimed to improve the precision of the collation by processing with CollateX software, which automates the location of alignments and deltas in multiple versions of a document. Processing plain text versions of the separate 1818 and 1831 edition files with CollateX would provide the basis for a thorough overhaul of the TEI encoding in the Romantic Circle's edition, because it would output a single document holding variations tagged according to the TEI P5 critical apparatus markup. The document output by CollateX is plain text that holds critical apparatus tagging, and represents a first phase of up-translation to a new and improved TEI document. The next stage would be to apply auto-tagging with regular expressions to reconstruct the body of the edition in TEI as a single document from which multiple editions can be generated for reading and for genetic studying of textual variation over time.</p>

						<p>Though our initial goal was to revise and improve the existing edition on Romantic Circles, we realized that we had an opportunity to produce a much richer edition, if we could incorporate a rarely studied 1823 edition of the novel into our collation. Incorporating this edition requires OCR of a Google Books scanned edition and careful correction to prepare a text file formatted consistently with the files representing the 1818 and 1831 editions. Finally, we would include pointers into the Shelley-Godwin Archive edition of the manuscript notebook drafts of the novel.</p>
