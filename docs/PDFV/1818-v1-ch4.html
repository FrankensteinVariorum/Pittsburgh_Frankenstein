    <h2><span id="" class="variant_display_mult">CHAPTER</span> IV.</h2>

    <p><span id="" class="variant_display_single">I<span class="smcap">t</span></span> was on a dreary night of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">November,</span> that I beheld <span id="" class="variant_display_single">the accomplishment</span> of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to <span id="" class="variant_display_single">agony,</span> I collected the instruments of life around <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me, that</span> I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">morning;</span> the rain pattered dismally against the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">panes,</span> and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">half-extinguished</span> light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature <span id="" class="variant_display_single">open; it</span> breathed <pb xml:id="1818_v1_110" n="098"/>hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its <span id="" class="variant_display_single">limbs.</span></p>

    <p><span id="" class="variant_display_single">How</span> can I describe my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">emotions</span> at this <span id="" class="variant_display_single">catastrophe,</span> or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to <span id="" class="variant_display_single">form?</span> His limbs were in <span id="" class="variant_display_single">proportion,</span> and I had selected his features as <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">beautiful. Beautiful!—Great</span> God! His <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">yellow</span> skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair <span id="" class="variant_display_single">was of</span> a lustrous <span id="" class="variant_display_single">black,</span> and <span id="" class="variant_display_single">flowing;</span> his teeth of a pearly <span id="" class="variant_display_single">whiteness;</span> but these <span id="" class="variant_display_single">luxuriances</span> only <span id="" class="variant_display_single">formed</span> a more horrid contrast with his watery <span id="" class="variant_display_single">eyes,</span> that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled <span id="" class="variant_display_single">complexion,</span> and <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">straight</span> black lips.</p>
	
	<p><span id="" class="variant_display_mult">The</span> different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for <pb xml:id="1818_v1_111" n="099"/> nearly two <span id="" class="variant_display_single">years,</span> for the sole purpose of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">infusing life</span> into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and <span id="" class="variant_display_single">health.</span> I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">finished,</span> the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable <span id="" class="variant_display_single">to</span> endure the aspect of the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">being</span> I had created, I rushed out of the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">room,</span> and <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued</span> a long time traversing my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">bed-chamber,</span> unable to compose my mind to sleep. At <span id="" class="variant_display_single">length</span> lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before <span id="" class="variant_display_single">endured;</span> and I threw myself on <span id="" class="variant_display_single">the</span> bed in my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">clothes,</span> endeavouring to seek a <span id="" class="variant_display_single">few</span> moments of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">forgetfulness.</span> But it was in <span id="" class="variant_display_single">vain:</span> I <span id="" class="variant_display_single">slept</span> <span id="" class="variant_display_single">indeed,</span> but I was disturbed by the wildest <span id="" class="variant_display_single">dreams. I thought</span> I saw Elizabeth, <span id="" class="variant_display_single">in</span> the bloom of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">health,</span> walking in the streets of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Ingolstadt.</span> <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Delighted and surprised,</span> I em<pb xml:id="1818_v1_112" n="100"/>braced <span id="" class="variant_display_single">her;</span> but as I imprinted the first kiss on her <span id="" class="variant_display_single">lips,</span> they became <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">livid</span> with the hue of death; her features appeared to <span id="" class="variant_display_single">change,</span> and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">arms; a</span> shroud <span id="" class="variant_display_single">enveloped</span> her <span id="" class="variant_display_single">form,</span> and I saw the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">grave-worms</span> crawling in the folds of the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">flannel.</span> I started <span id="" class="variant_display_single">from</span> my sleep with <span id="" class="variant_display_single">horror;</span> a cold dew covered my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">forehead,</span> my teeth <span id="" class="variant_display_single">chattered,</span> and every limb <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">became convulsed;</span> when, by the dim and yellow light of the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">moon,</span> as it forced its way through the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">window-shutters,</span> I beheld the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">wretch—the</span> miserable monster whom I had <span id="" class="variant_display_single">created.</span> <span id="" class="variant_display_single">He</span> held up <span id="" class="variant_display_single">the curtain of</span> the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">bed;</span> and his <span id="" class="variant_display_single">eyes,</span> if eyes they may be <span id="" class="variant_display_single">called,</span> were fixed on <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me. His</span> jaws <span id="" class="variant_display_single">opened,</span> and he muttered some inarticulate <span id="" class="variant_display_single">sounds,</span> while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have <span id="" class="variant_display_single">spoken,</span> but I did not <span id="" class="variant_display_single">hear;</span> one hand was <pb xml:id="1818_v1_113" n="101"/>stretched <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">out, seemingly</span> to detain <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me,</span> but I <span id="" class="variant_display_single">escaped,</span> and rushed down <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">stairs.</span> I took refuge in <span id="" class="variant_display_single">the</span> court-yard belonging to the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">night,</span> walking up and down in the greatest <span id="" class="variant_display_single">agitation,</span> listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">approach</span> of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</p>

	<p>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy <span id="" class="variant_display_single">again</span> endued with <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">animation</span> could not be so hideous as <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">that wretch</span>. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly <span id="" class="variant_display_single">then; but</span> when those muscles and joints were <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">rendered capable of motion,</span> it became a thing such as even Dante could <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">not</span> have conceived.</p>

	<p>I passed the night <span id="" class="variant_display_single">wretchedly.</span> Sometimes my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">pulse</span> beat so quickly and <pb xml:id="1818_v1_114" n="102"/><span id="" class="variant_display_single">hardly,</span> that I felt the palpitation of every <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">artery; at others,</span> I nearly <span id="" class="variant_display_single">sank</span> to the ground <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">through</span> languor and extreme weakness. <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">Mingled</span> with this <span id="" class="variant_display_single">horror,</span> I felt the bitterness of <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">disappointment: dreams</span> that had been my food and <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">pleasant</span> rest for so long a <span id="" class="variant_display_single">space,</span> were now become a hell to <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me;</span> and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so <span id="" class="variant_display_single">complete!</span></p>

	<p><span id="" class="variant_display_single">Morning,</span> dismal and <span id="" class="variant_display_single">wet,</span> at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Ingolstadt,</span> its white steeple <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">and clock,</span> which <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">indicated</span> the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">sixth</span> hour. The porter opened the gates of the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">court,</span> which had that night been my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">asylum,</span> and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick <span id="" class="variant_display_single">steps,</span> as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning <span id="" class="variant_display_single">of</span> the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">apartment</span> which I <span id="" class="variant_display_single">inhabited,</span> but felt <pb xml:id="1818_v1_115" n="103"/>impelled to hurry <span id="" class="variant_display_single">on,</span> although <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">wetted</span> by the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">rain,</span> which poured from a black and comfortless sky.</p>

	<p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, <span id="" class="variant_display_single">endeavouring,</span> by bodily <span id="" class="variant_display_single">exercise,</span> to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">streets,</span> without any clear conception of where I <span id="" class="variant_display_single">was,</span> or what I was <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">doing. My</span> heart palpitated <span id="" class="variant_display_single">in</span> the sickness of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">fear;</span> and I hurried on with irregular <span id="" class="variant_display_single">steps,</span> not daring to look about <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me:</span></p>

	<blockquote class="poem">

	<p><span id="" class="variant_display_single">Continuing</span> thus, I came at <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">length opposite</span> to the inn at which the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">various</span> diligences and carriages usually stopped. <pb xml:id="1818_v1_116" n="104"/>Here I <span id="" class="variant_display_single">paused,</span> I knew not <span id="" class="variant_display_single">why;</span> but <span id="" class="variant_display_single">I</span> remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As <span id="" class="variant_display_single">it</span> drew <span id="" class="variant_display_single">nearer,</span> I observed that it was the Swiss <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">diligence: it</span> stopped just where I was <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">standing; and,</span> on the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">door</span> being <span id="" class="variant_display_single">opened,</span> I perceived Henry Clerval, <span id="" class="variant_display_single">who,</span> on seeing <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me,</span> instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed <span id="" class="variant_display_single">he,</span> “how glad I am to see <span id="" class="variant_display_single">you!</span> how fortunate that you should be here at the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">very</span> moment of my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">alighting!</span>”</p>

	<p>Nothing could equal my delight on <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">seeing Clerval;</span> his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Elizabeth,</span> and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and <span id="" class="variant_display_single">misfortune;</span> I felt <span id="" class="variant_display_single">suddenly,</span> and for the first time <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">during</span> many months, <pb xml:id="1818_v1_117" n="105"/>calm and serene joy. I welcomed my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">friend,</span> therefore, in the most cordial <span id="" class="variant_display_single">manner,</span> and we walked towards my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">college.</span> Clerval <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_single">friends,</span> and his <span id="" class="variant_display_single">own good</span> fortune in being <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">permitted</span> to come to Ingolstadt. “You may <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">easily believe,</span>” said he, <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">“how great was the difficulty to persuade</span> my father that <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">it was not absolutely necessary</span> <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">for a merchant not to understand any thing except book-keeping; and, indeed,</span> I believe I left him incredulous to the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_single">last,</span> for his constant answer to my <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">unwearied entreaties was</span> the same as <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_single">that of the</span> <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Dutch</span> <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_single">schoolmaster</span> in the Vicar of <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">Wakefield: ‘I</span> have ten thousand <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">continued talking</span> for some time about our mutual <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">florins a year without Greek, I eat</span> heartily without Greek.’ But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">of learning,</span> and he <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">has</span> permitted me <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">to undertake</span> <pb xml:id="1818_v1_118" n="106"/>a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.”</p>

	<p><span id="" class="variant_display_mult">“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left</span> my father, <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">brothers, and Elizabeth.</span>”</p>

	<p><span id="" class="variant_display_mult">“Very well,</span> and very <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">happy, only</span> a little uneasy that <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">they</span> hear from you so <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">seldom. By</span> the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">bye,</span> I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.—But, my dear <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Frankenstein,</span>” continued <span id="" class="variant_display_single">he,</span> stopping <span id="" class="variant_display_single">short,</span> and gazing full in my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">face,</span> “I did not before remark how very ill you <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">appear; so</span> thin and pale; you <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">look</span> as if you had been watching for several nights.”</p>

	<p>“You have guessed <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">right; I</span> have lately been so <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">deeply engaged</span> in one <span id="" class="variant_display_single">occupation,</span> that I <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">have not allowed myself</span> sufficient <span id="" class="variant_display_single">rest,</span> as you <span id="" class="variant_display_single">see:</span> but I hope, I sincerely <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">hope, that</span> all <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">these employments</span> are <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">now</span> at an <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">end, and that I am at length free.</span>”</p>

	<p><pb xml:id="1818_v1_119" n="107"/>I trembled <span id="" class="variant_display_single">excessively;</span> I could not <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">endure</span> to think <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">of, and</span> far less to allude <span id="" class="variant_display_single">to</span> the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">occurrences</span> of the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">preceding</span> night. <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">I walked</span> with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">college</span>. I then <span id="" class="variant_display_single">reflected, and</span> the thought made me <span id="" class="variant_display_single">shiver,</span> that the creature whom I had left in my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">apartment</span> might <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">still</span> be <span id="" class="variant_display_single">there, alive,</span> and walking about. I dreaded to <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">behold this monster;</span> but I <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">feared</span> still more that Henry should <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">see him.</span> Entreating <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">him therefore to</span> remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">I</span> darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">of the door</span> before I <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">recollected myself</span>. I <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">then paused; and</span> a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">forcibly open</span>, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">side; but</span> nothing <pb xml:id="1818_v1_120" n="108"/>appeared. I stepped fearfully <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">in: the apartment</span> was <span id="" class="variant_display_single">empty;</span> and my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">bed-room</span> was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">believe</span> that so great a <span id="" class="variant_display_single">good-fortune</span> could have befallen me; but when I <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">became</span> assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for <span id="" class="variant_display_single">joy,</span> and ran down to <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">Clerval</span>.</p>

	<p>We ascended into my <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">room, and</span> the servant <span id="" class="variant_display_single">presently</span> brought <span id="" class="variant_display_single">breakfast;</span> but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me; I</span> felt my flesh tingle with excess of <span id="" class="variant_display_single">sensitiveness,</span> and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same <span id="" class="variant_display_single">place; I</span> jumped over the chairs, clapped my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">hands, and</span> laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his <span id="" class="variant_display_single">arrival; but</span> when he observed me <span id="" class="variant_display_single">more attentively,</span> he saw a wildness in <pb xml:id="1818_v1_121" n="109"/>my eyes for which he could not <span id="" class="variant_display_single">account;</span> and my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">loud, unrestrained,</span> heartless <span id="" class="variant_display_single">laughter,</span> frightened and astonished him.</p>

	<p>“My dear <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">Victor</span>,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake, is the <span id="" class="variant_display_single">matter?</span> Do not laugh <span id="" class="variant_display_single">in that manner</span>. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?”</p>

	<p>“Do not ask <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me,</span>” cried I, putting my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">hands</span> before my eyes, for I thought I saw the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">dreaded</span> spectre glide into the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">room; “he can tell.—Oh,</span> save me! save <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me!</span>” I imagined that the monster seized <span id="" class="variant_display_single">me;</span> I struggled furiously, and fell down in a fit.</p>

	<p>Poor Clerval! what must have been his <span id="" class="variant_display_single">feelings?</span> A <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">meeting,</span> which he <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">anticipated</span> with such <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">joy,</span> so strangely turned to bitterness. But I <span id="" class="variant_display_single">was</span> not <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">the</span> witness <span id="" class="variant_display_single">of</span> his <span id="" class="variant_display_single">grief;</span> for I was <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">lifeless</span>, and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.</p>

	<p><pb xml:id="1818_v1_122" n="110"/><span id="" class="variant_display_mult"><!-- diff = chapter 7 in manuscript alone -->This</span> was the commencement of a nervous <span id="" class="variant_display_single">fever,</span> which confined me for several months. During all <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">that</span> time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned <span id="" class="variant_display_single">that,</span> knowing my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">father’s</span> advanced <span id="" class="variant_display_single">age,</span> and unfitness for so long a <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">journey, and how</span> wretched <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">my sickness</span> would <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">make Elizabeth,</span> he <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">spared</span> them this <span id="" class="variant_display_single">grief</span> by <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">concealing</span> the extent of my <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">disorder</span>. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">himself; and,</span> firm in the hope he <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">felt</span> of my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">recovery,</span> he did not doubt <span id="" class="variant_display_single">that,</span> instead of doing <span id="" class="variant_display_single">harm,</span> he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.</p>

	<p>But I was in reality very <span id="" class="variant_display_single">ill;</span> and surely nothing but the unbounded <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">and</span> unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">monster</span> on whom I had bestowed <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">existence</span> was for ever before <pb xml:id="1818_v1_123" n="111"/>my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">Doubtless my</span> words<span id="" class="variant_display_mult"> surprised</span> <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Henry:</span> he at first believed them <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">to be</span> the wanderings of my <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">disturbed</span> imagination; but <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">the </span>pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same <span id="" class="variant_display_single">subject</span> persuaded him that my disorder <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">indeed</span> owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">event</span>.</p>

	<p>By very slow <span id="" class="variant_display_single">degrees,</span> and with frequent <span id="" class="variant_display_single">relapses</span> that alarmed and grieved my <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">friend,</span> I recovered. I remember <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">the</span> first time I <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">became</span> capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had <span id="" class="variant_display_single">disappeared,</span> and that <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">the</span> young buds were shooting forth from the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">trees that shaded my window</span>. It was a divine <span id="" class="variant_display_single">spring;</span> and the <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">season</span> contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my <span id="" class="variant_display_single">bosom;</span> my <pb xml:id="1818_v1_124" n="112"/>gloom <span id="" class="variant_display_single">disappeared,</span> and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">passion</span>.</p>

	<p>“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">being spent</span> in <span id="" class="variant_display_single">study,</span> as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">room. How</span> shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">of which</span> I have been the occasion; but you will forgive me.”</p>

	<p>“You will repay me entirely, if you do not <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">discompose yourself, but</span> get well as fast as you <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">can; and</span> since you appear in such good <span id="" class="variant_display_single">spirits,</span> I may speak to you on one <span id="" class="variant_display_single">subject,</span> may I not?”</p>

	<p>I <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">trembled. One</span> subject! what could it be? Could he allude <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">to an</span> object on whom I dared not even <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">think?<span id="" class="variant_display_mult"></p>

		<p><pb xml:id="1818_v1_125" n="113"/>“<span id="" class="variant_display_mult">Compose yourself,”</span> said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, “I will not mention <span id="" class="variant_display_single">it,</span> if it agitates <span id="" class="variant_display_single">you;</span> but your father and cousin would be <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">very</span> happy if they received a letter from you in your own <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">hand-writing.</span> They hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at your long silence.”</p>

		<p>“Is that <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">all? my</span> dear <span id="" class="variant_display_single">Henry.</span> How could you suppose that my first <span id="" class="variant_display_single">thought</span> would not <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">fly towards those</span> dear, dear friends whom I <span id="" class="variant_display_single">love,</span> and who are so deserving of my love.”</p>

		<p>“If this is your present <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">temper, my friend, you</span> will <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">perhaps</span> be glad to see a <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">letter</span> that has been <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">lying</span> here some days <span id="" class="variant_display_mult">for you:</span> it is from your cousin, I believe.”</p>
