# Pittsburgh Bicentennial Frankenstein Project

Welcome to our GitHub Page!
We are working on preparing a new digital edition of the novel _Frankenstein_ in its first three editions for the bicentennial of its first publication in 1818. Our edition is a digital collation of five distinct versions of the novel produced between 1816 and 1831.

### "Beta editions" ready for reading: 
* [1818 publication of _Frankenstein_](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818.html). 

* [1823 publication of _Frankenstein_ (supervised by William Godwin)](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1823.html).

* [1831 publication of _Frankenstein_](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1831.html).

### Teaching copy:
* [Pitt-Greensburg classroom edition of the 1818 text](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818_classEd.html) (a copy of the same) for use in annotation assignments.

### Coming soon: 
* The Thomas text (an edition representing Mary Shelley's edits handwritten on an 1818 edition of the novel).
* Collated editions of the 1816 draft notebooks (based on Shelley-Godwin Archive documents), 1818, Thomas text, 1823, and 1831 versions.
