# Pittsburgh Bicentennial Frankenstein Project

Welcome to our GitHub Page!
We are working on preparing a new digital edition of the novel _Frankenstein_ in its first three editions in time for the bicentennial of its first publication in 1818, and collating it with MITH's Shelley-Godwin Archive edition of _Frankenstein_'s manuscript notebooks.

### Ready for reading: 
* our ["Beta edition" of the 1818 publication of _Frankenstein_](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818.html). 

* [Pitt-Greensburg classroom edition](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818_classEd.html) (a copy of the same) for use in annotation assignments.

### About *Frankenstein* and our variorum project:
* [Bicentennial Bits and Bytes: The Pittsburgh Digital Frankenstein Project](http://slides.com/elisabeshero-bondar/mla_bicentfrank): MLA 2018 panel presentation on our variorum edition project, reconciling previous digital editions, ongoing stylometric research, and annotation development. 

* [*Frankenstein* and Text Genetics](http://bit.ly/FrankenTextGen): an introduction to the novel and its contexts, and our project's connection with the Shelley-Godwin Archive

* a slide presentation by Elisa Beshero-Bondar and Raffaele Viglianti for the 2017 NASSR Conference on 11 August 2017: [http://bit.ly/NASSR_BicFrank](http://bit.ly/NASSR_BicFrank) 

* Balisage Proceedings for the Symposium on Up-Conversion and Up-Translation (31 July 2017): [Rebuilding a digital Frankenstein by 2018: Towards a theory of losses and gains in up-translation](https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol20/html/Beshero-Bondar01/BalisageVol20-Beshero-Bondar01.html)

More resources, including editions of the 1823 and 1831 versions of the novel, will become available here as our project develops.
