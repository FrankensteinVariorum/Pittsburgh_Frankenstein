# Pittsburgh Bicentennial Frankenstein Project

Welcome to our GitHub Page!
We are working on preparing a new digital edition of the novel _Frankenstein_ in its first three editions in time for the bicentennial of its first publication in 1818, and collating it with MITH's Shelley-Godwin Archive edition of _Frankenstein_'s manuscript notebooks.

Check out our ["Beta edition" of the 1818 publication of _Frankenstein_](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818.html), and slide presentation introducing the project, for MITH's Society for Textual Scholarship Conference: [http://bit.ly/frankenBodyText](http://bit.ly/frankenBodyText) 

More resources, including editions of the 1823 and 1831 versions of the novel, will become available here as our project develops.
