# Pittsburgh Bicentennial Frankenstein Project

Welcome to our GitHub Page!
We are working on preparing a new digital edition of the novel _Frankenstein_ in its first three editions in time for the bicentennial of its first publication in 1818. 

Check out our ["Beta edition" of the 1818 publication of _Frankenstein_](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/Frankenstein_1818.html).

More resources, including editions of the 1823 and 1831 versions of the novel, will become available here as our project develops.
