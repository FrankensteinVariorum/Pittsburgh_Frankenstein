        <p>Welcome to our GitHub Pages landing page. We are working on preparing a new digital edition of the novel Frankenstein in its first three editions in time for the bicentennial of its first publication in 1818. Resources will become available here as our project develops. In the meantime, you can peek at our coding underway in <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein">our GitHub repo</a>.</p>
